# FRI
**Messy Audio Machines**  
Women's Center For Creative Work  
7:30pm - 9:30pm  
FREE  
*Messy Audio Machines is an exploration of gender, race, and sexuality of historical and contemporary electronic music as seen in disco, techno, house, hip hop, and experimental music. We will use various audio machines like the synthesizer, drum machine, and sampler as locations of such inquiry. Starting from modern mechanical and engineering advances in sound, we will peel back the layers upon layers of social and cultural meaning. This exercise seeks to reveal some of the the contested meaning-making processes and rituals electronic musicians (and their listeners) engage in.*

# SUN
**Dinner Party Politics: Food Culture in the Eastern Bloc**  
The Wende Museum of the Cold War, Culver City  
3pm - 5pm  
FREE  
*Food is a powerful medium that can carry both personal and political meaning. We have strong emotional connections to the things we eat, which are tied to memory, heritage, and tradition. Food also plays a part in constructing national identities and expressing societal values. Through a survey of fine art, posters, menus, and films, Dinner Party Politics: Food Culture in the Eastern Bloc examines the ideological goals, gender roles, and individual desires expressed by the production and consumption of food in socialist countries during the Cold War. Light refreshment will be served. NOTE: Please RSVP to rsvp@wendemuseum.org*
