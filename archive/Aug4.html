<em>Beginning in the late 1960s, a number of promising African and African American students entered the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, recruited under a concerted initiative by C.Z. Wilson to be more responsive to various communities of color. From that first class through the late 1980s, and continuing well beyond their college dayts, to now, these filmmakers came to represent the first sustained undertaking to forge an alternative Black Cinema practice in the United States. Tonightâ€™s program includes a short films by Ijeoma Iloputaife, Barbara McCullough, Alile Sharon Larkin and Storme (Bright) Sweet.</em><br />

<p><strong>Action! presents Nobel Nok Dah &amp; films from Ethnocine Collective</strong><br />
Echo Park Film Center<br />
7:30pm - 10pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Nobel Nok Dah offers an intimate view into the lives of three refugee women from Burma, whose migratory paths cross in Thailand and eventually meet when they resettle to central New York. Drawing upon methods of feminist oral history and ethno-fiction, the film traces glimmers of subjectivity that complicate any singular narrative of the refugee experience. As camera movements follow the textures of everyday life and work, a weave of sensorial fragments immerse audiences in women's narratives of self, place, and belonging. SCREENS WITH 2 OTHER FILMS. SEE LINK FOR DETAILS!</em><br />
