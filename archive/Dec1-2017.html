<p><strong>Johanna Breiding and John Hulsey: break down, re source</strong><br />
Los Angeles Contemporary Archive<br />
7pm - 10pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Approached as a dialogue between the artists‚Äô video installation and photograph within the archive/exhibition space, break down, re source presents two research-based practitioners rooted in experimental documentary filmmaking and photography. The two artists investigate possessions of land and its material evidence - markers, language, historical narratives - embedded within their respective spaces of inquiry.The Land Under Iron, 2017The Land Under Iron addresses the enduring legacy of colonialism and settlement in the American West. Borrowing the visual language of highway signs that orient the flow of traffic around road closures and construction zones, these works redirect passersby along an alternate axis of experience ‚Äî offering a rumination on lines, boundaries, demarcations, and the ways in which systems of enclosure have ramified power from the 16th century to the present. Moving between Downtown Los Angeles, where tower cranes pierce the landscape, and San Pedro‚Äôs Fort MacArthur, a retired naval base overlooking the Port of Los Angeles, the project asks the viewer to navigate between two spatial forms etched onto the landscape: the construction zone that prefigures the luxury enclave and portends displacement, and the military fortification that points toward a history of imperial occupation and conquest.</em><br />

<p><strong>Patrick Martinez: America is for Dreamers - opening reception</strong><br />
Vincent Price Art Museum<br />
5pm - 7pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>In his first solo museum exhibiton in Los Angeles, America is for Dreamers, artist Patrick Martinez responds to the ever-shifting landscape of the contemporary American built environment, a physical construct that can be understood in relationship to social and political contexts. Martinez uses painting, sculpture, neon and installation to comment on issues affecting communities nationally, while responding to specificities associated with the City of Los Angeles, including its overlapping and intersectional modern hybrid cultural identities. His works often call into question issues of police violence and authoritarianism exercised against youth and communities of color, as well as highlight vernacular language, architecture, and food culture associated with the urban lexicon.</em><br />

<p><strong>Dark Ambient Sound Bath</strong><br />
Pieter Performance Space<br />
8pm - 10pm<br />
$25<br />
<em>The Dark Ambient Sound Bath is a unique experience. Our focus here, like most sound baths, is healing, however, our methods are different. A sound bath is an improvisational concert of sound and vibration geared toward healing and relaxation of the participant utilizing gongs, chimes and crystal bowls. Most sound bath experiences are centered around love and light. While those can be helpful and useful, We found a deficit in the recognition of our shadow selves. This is about balance. This is a safe place for your primal self to be honored and expressed. The theme for this experience is ENTROPY. We will be guiding a meditation and breath work technique to tap into an altered mindset. You will then be bathed in sounds of dark ambient music by live electronic musicians to inspire your own unique journey. You may experience an emotional response, visions, or bodily impulses. Live musicians are Adam Thompson and Skye X Meditation and breath work guided by Lauren Davis</em><br />
