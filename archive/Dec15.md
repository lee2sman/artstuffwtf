**Geographies of Displacement**
Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery
7pm - 9pm
FREE
*Geographies of Displacement will bring together six anti-gentrification groups across East and South Los Angeles: the Crenshaw Subway Coalition, Defend Boyle Heights, North East Los Angeles Alliance, LA Tenants Union, School of Echoes, and Uplifting Inglewood. In this discussion, groups will share their organizing work, contextualize the specific ways in which gentrification is taking place in their neighborhoods, and address how the role of the culture industry opens communities to speculative real estate practices. They will also deliberate how practices of solidarity can develop into a city-wide movement against unjust displacement.*

**LA Philharmonic - Adams @70: El Nino**  
Walt Disney Concert Hall  
8pm  
$10 - $183  
*Having set himself the extraordinarily ambitious goal of a nativity oratorio for our time, John Adams succeeded spectacularly. With multilingual texts drawn from Scripture, medieval tracts and contemporary poetry, the work is powerful, provocative and, ultimately, deeply touching. An orchestra of approximately 45 musicians includes two steel-string guitars and a keyboard sampler.*

**Terry Riley, with Gyan Riley, featuring artist Peter Coffin**

FREE (reserve tickets via link below)  
*Join us for a rare and original performance with the renowned and widely influential composer Terry Riley, known as the father of minimalism for his groundbreaking 1964 work 'In C'. Together with his son, composer and guitarist Gyan Riley, they will perform in response to Untitled (Shepard-Risset Glissando with Color) a new artwork by New York conceptual artist Peter Coffin. The Getty's auditorium will be transformed by Coffin through an immersive projection of radiant fields of color that shift through the spectrum in tandem with the Shepard-Risset Glissando, an auditory illusion of oscillating sound waves.*

**Poetic Research Bureau**  
The Hammer Museum  
11:30am - 5pm  
FREE  
*The Poetic Research Bureau, a project space for language-centered art and inquiry anchored in Chinatown’s Chung King Road gallery district, brings @SEA, its monthly “live magazine” of film, video, poetry, performance and rogue scholarship, to the Hammer Museum. Each @SEA program loosely constellates around a one-word theme, and this Sunday’s keyword is “BORDERLESS”–offering a necessary critique and riposte to the current political climate of uncompromising nativism while bringing in artists and work marked by fluidity, interdisciplinarity, myriad border-crossings and uncontained curiosities.*
