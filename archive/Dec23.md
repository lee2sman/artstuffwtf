**Closing Day of Tamara Henderson: Seasons End: Panting Healer**  
REDCAT  
12-6pm  
FREE  
*Tamara Henderson’s writings, sculptures, 16mm films and paintings often refer to dreamscapes that the artist reconstructs in the exhibition space. She creates sculptures inspired by a process of notating ideas while under hypnosis, and her films are surrealist tales of passage, transformation and decay, in which objects and images are personified and imbued with the artist’s personal history and memories. Henderson collects objects from various sources, including found and recycled items and gifts gathered throughout her travels, and assembles them into large-scale installations.*

**Belladonna of Sadness**  
The Cinefamily  
10:15pm (runs Christmas night through Wednesday)  
$12  
*One of the great lost masterpieces of Japanese animation, never before officially released in the U.S., Belladonna of Sadness is a mad, swirling, psychedelic light-show of medieval tarot-card imagery with horned demons, haunted forests and La Belle Dame Sans Merci, equal parts J.R.R. Tolkien and gorgeous, explicit Gustav Klimt-influenced eroticism. The last film in the adult-themed Animerama trilogy produced by the godfather of Japanese anime & manga, Osamu Tezuka and directed by his long time collaborator Eiichi Yamamoto (Astro Boy and Kimba The White Lion), Belladonna unfolds as a series of spectacular still watercolor paintings that bleed and twist together. An innocent young woman, Jeanne (voiced by Aiko Nagayama) is violently raped by the local lord on her wedding night. To take revenge, she makes a pact with the Devil himself (voiced by Tatsuya Nakadai, from Akira Kurosawa’s Ran) who appears as an erotic sprite and transforms her into a black-robed vision of madness and desire.*
