<p><strong>The Music of Mark Trayle</strong><br />
REDCAT<br />
8:30pm<br />
$20 / $10 students<br />
<em>The superbly imaginative, sonically expansive work of composer and sound artist Mark Trayle (1955–2015) is the subject of this tribute by friends, colleagues and former students in The Hub and Bitpanic. Co-founded by Trayle in 1986, The Hub emerged out of the Mills College scene to become the most influential improvising electronic ensemble since Musica Elettronica Viva (MEV). Known for using networked electronic and digital systems of its own devising, the Bay Area group currently consists of John Bischoff, Chris Brown, Tim Perkis, Scot Gresham-Lancaster, Phil Stone and Matt Ingalls. Adding to the computer music lineage pioneered by The Hub is the recently formed collective Bitpanic. Based in Los Angeles, it comprises Casey Anderson, Scott Cazan, Clay Chaplin, David Paha and Stephanie Smith—all one-time students of Trayle at CalArts.</em><br />

Gloria Steinem is a writer, lecturer, political activist, and feminist organizer. She travels in this and other countries as an organizer and lecturer and is a frequent media spokeswoman on issues of equality.

She co-created and directs the new series I Love Dick, adapted from Chris Kraus’s critically acclaimed novel of the same title.

Her first feature, Afternoon Delight, won the 2013 Directing Award at Sundance. Outside of the world of TV and film, Jill co-created theatrical experiences The Real Live Brady Bunch, The Miss Vagina Pageant, Hollywood Hellhouse and Sit and Spin and co-founded community organization East Side Jews. She is the author of the memoir Tiny Ladies in Shiny Pants and the upcoming memoir Would You Still Love Me If.</em><br />
