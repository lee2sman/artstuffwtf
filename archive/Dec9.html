<p><strong>Show #27: Brenna Murphy</strong><br />
And/Or Gallery<br />
6pm - 9pm<br />
<em>Brenna Murphy's first solo show in LA will feature tapestries, 3D-printed sculptures, and a room-scale virtual reality installation. Building on this hyper-dimensional approach, Show #27 will feature a range of new pieces across media, including tapestries, 3D-printed sculptures, video works, and a special virtual reality installation, which promises to be the fullest expression of Murphy's desire to create a fluid portal between physical and virtual realms. After entering the installation within the gallery, the viewer will use a VR headset to navigate a virtual sculptural world of abstracted natural elements that complements the physical domain and functions as a vast overlay of it. The Fotomuseum Winterthur and the Julius Bär Foundation recently awarded this work the 2016 P3 Post-Photography Prototyping Prize. </em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/114807245677437/">INFO</a></p>
