<em>Music by Tashi Wada performed by Charles Curtis, Dafne Vicente-Sandoval, Tashi Wada and Julia Holter. This program collects three long-form works by composer Tashi Wada that explore diverging aspects of tuning and tonality. Valence (2016), written for cellist Charles Curtis, isolates and reharmonizes the natural overtones of a single string, destabilizing and fusing tone and timbre through a delicate alchemy. Witness (2017), written for bassoonist Dafne Vicente-Sandoval, draws out the relationship between an array of scales and tetrachords (four-note segments of scales) found traditionally in Greek, Persian, and Arabic musics, in combination with hybrid and invented scales, through repetition, variation, and improvisation. Mutable Signs, Wada‚Äôs performance for keyboard, voice, and sirens with guest musician Julia Holter, focuses on the outer edges of historical, non-equal temperaments, eliciting a more distant, uneven sense of tonality.</em><br />
