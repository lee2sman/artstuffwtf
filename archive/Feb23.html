<p><strong>Busta Rhymes at the End of the World</strong><br />
Machine Project<br />
8pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>The lecture will explore Busta Rhymes and his suite of apocalyptic concept albums ‚Äî The Coming (1996), When Disaster Strikes (1997), Extinction Level Event (1998), Anarchy (2000), and Genesis (2001) ‚Äî and their accompanying visuals. Over the course of the five albums, Busta Rhymes weaves a complex narrative of global demise and eventual regeneration of which he (the ‚Äòblack child‚Äô, the ‚Äòblack man‚Äô) is at the center. In this talk, I suggest that Busta‚Äôs apocalypse speaks to something beyond generalized global crisis at the millennium‚Äìand fear of what the millennium would bring, instead speaking to an apocalyptic blackness that is influenced by both afrofuturism and Busta‚Äôs relationship to the Five Percent Nation, and resonates with directions in black radical thought, both new and old.</em><br />

<p><strong>Show #28: Jacob Ciocci</strong><br />
And/Or Gallery<br />
6pm - 9:30pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>And/Or Gallery is pleased to announce Jacob Ciocci‚Äôs debut solo show in Los Angeles. In his videos, paintings, and performances, Ciocci uses pop culture, nostalgia, and branding to explore profound and mundane expressions of freedom, authenticity, suffering, and rage. Although he works across media, his art most often takes the form of collage, with Ciocci combining his own existential questioning and philosophical consolations with absurd found footage and other cultural detritus culled from the internet, the trash, or the nearest strip mall of franchised chains. For Ciocci, internet culture is analogous to melancholy in that both constantly flit between meaningless and meaning, between poignancy and banality, between the gleeful and the ghastly. As the artist says, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get the shareable culture we want; we get the shareable culture we deserve.‚Äù</em><br />
