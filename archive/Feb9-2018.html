<p><strong>Curating Resistance: Punk as Archival Method Conference at UCLA</strong><br />
UClA Herb Alpert School of Music<br />
10am - 6pm (also Saturday)<br />
FREE<br />
<em>At a time when performative resistances to exploitative mainstream cultural practices are increasingly under attack, punk persists as an important space for cultivating and curating expressive means. Bringing together scholars, musicians, fans, writers, and community members, including bands, public intellectuals, and workshops, Curating Resistance: Punk as Archival Method is teaming up with the UCLA Library Special Collections ‚ÄúPunk Archive‚Äù for hands-on, thoughtful community building within, across, and beyond the university. The two-day event will consist of music, panels, installations, presentations, zines, hands on workshops, and so much more! We have received submissions from punk scholars, public intellectuals, music writers, resistant historians, critical students, misfit theorizers, poets, activists, queer thinkers, feminists, archivists, freaky writers, and lots of people interested in how punk‚Äôs resistant music, history, and philosophies are protected, preserved, and circulated as well as the stakes of these practices.</em><br />

<p><strong>MELEKO MOKGOSI: BREAD, BUTTER, AND POWER - Opening Party</strong><br />
Fowler Museum<br />
6pm - 9pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Meleko Mokgosi‚Äôs large-scale episodic painting cycle Bread, Butter, and Power forms the newest chapter in his ongoing series Democratic Intuition, which seeks to explore ideas about the many ways that democratic concepts influence our lives, loves, and relationships on macro- and micro-levels. This twenty-panel installation interrogates the theme of feminism in the context of southern Africa, and considers the consequences of dividing labor practices by gender. Mokgosi‚Äôs approach to storytelling through the form of history painting allows us to compare what we see in the paintings to the realities of inequality and gendered labor division we know from experience. This approach to the content also inspires us to think expansively about politics, power structures, and the role of history in the creation of the current nations of southern Africa.</em><br />
