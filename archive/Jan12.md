**Decentralizing The Web: Screening 002 - Lumapit Sa Akin, Paraiso**  
UCLA Broad Arts Center, EDA  
7pm  
FREE  
*DECENTRALIZING THE WEB presents a screening of LUMAPIT SA AKIN, PARAISO + artist talk on female domestic labor, gendered migration, and science fiction featuring director Stephanie Comilang.  Lumapit Sa Akin, Paraiso (Come to Me Paradise) is a science fiction documentary by Stephanie Comilang that uses the backdrop of Hong Kong and the various ways in which the Filipina migrant worker occupies Central on Sundays. The film is narrated from the perspective of Paraiso, a ghost played by a drone who speaks of the isolation from being uprooted and thrown into a new place. Paraiso’s reprieve comes when she is finally able to interact with the women and feel her purpose, which is to transmit their vlogs, photos, and messages back home. During the week she is forced back into isolation and is left in an existential rut.*

**JON RAFMAN / STAN VANDERBEEK**  
SPRÜTH MAGERS  
6 - 8pm reception, open daily Tue - Sat 10am - 6pm  
FREE  
*Projections loom around us as virtual simulations on screens across our everyday life; equally, they appear within us, as memory in our minds and feelings in our bodies. Manuel De Landa states that condition of simulation requires that, “We need to acknowledge that we have built these layers of virtuality and that they are real, they are real virtual.” The exhibition raises questions regarding how simulated worlds change our behavior and our relationships to others and ourselves. What do we feel, here and now, in the very presence of our body, if artificial worlds enter deep into our emotions, suggesting to us what we should feel and what we should like in an unconscious, timeless present? Rafman and VanDerBeek’s art reflects a contemporary moment when digital tools, animation and virtual worlds are constant presences; they explore the impact on our identities and our understanding of life.*

**Theaster Gates: But To Be A Poor Race**  
Regen Projects  
6pm - 8pm reception. Conversation between Theaster Gates and curator Hamza Walker Sunday at 2pm    
FREE  
*Gates is internationally renowned for his cross-disciplinary practice that spans sculpture, painting, sound, and performance. Featuring all new works, many of which will be created on site, this exhibition marks the artist’s continued investigation into the relationship between visual politics, shamanism, and object making.
The title of the exhibition refers to American sociologist and civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois’ seminal work The Souls of Black Folk. Comprised of 14 essays that portray the genius and humanity of the Black race, this publication is considered an important work in sociology and African American literary history. Inspired by Du Bois’ sociological studies on the advancements of Black Americans from the time of Emancipation to 1900, the exhibition will feature a series of response paintings in which the statistical data gathered and made visual by Du Bois has been reduced to abstract color fields and geometric motifs. Both an act of homage to Du Bois’ sophisticated Modernism as well as a reference to the history of art, Gates’ paintings give poetic form to the archival. Also on view will be the debut of a new video work entitled Sweet Land of Liberty. Depicting a performance featuring Gates and the experimental music ensemble The Black Monks of Mississippi. Serving as a marking point of artistic and formal reflection, the sculptures, paintings, and video on view in the exhibition present Gates’ recent inquiries into the role of painting, history making, the power of material culture, and the polemics of patriotism.*
