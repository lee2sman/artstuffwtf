Audiences are invited to come and go as they wish.</em><br />

<p><strong>La Pista de Baile</strong><br />
LACE<br />
6pm - 10pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>In collaboration with the Los Angeles LGBT Center, Kaos Network, Southern California Library, Dublab, Hollywood and Boyle Heights Farmers' Market and more. As part of the Getty initiative PST:LA/LA, LACE presents &quot;La Pista de Baile&quot;, a participatory performance by Colectivo AM from Mexico City. This project reflects and rethinks how community relationships are articulated in Los Angeles by connecting communities in one collective performance. La Pista de Baile, a public invitation to dance together with local DJs, shortens geographical and cultural distances between participants. In the week before the performance, Colectivo AM will document dance steps across LA using a portable photo booth to add to the Banco Universal de Pasos, with a Living Research Station displaying the findings in LACE‚Äôs storefront. The completed Banco will be presented at the final performance. &quot;La Pista de Baile&quot; will address the question of how to create community relationships that can evolve into political actions. Intended not only for mature and specialist audiences but embracing popular culture, the project will encourage a wide range of participatory and diverse publics. Colectivo AM has researched choreographic phenomena that emerge from everyday life, far from the art world, from viral videos to protests. Colectivo AM‚Äôs explorations hold the highest potential for radicalizing choreographic practice.</em><br />

<p><strong>Experimental Latin American film: Cinema Critiques Cinema</strong><br />
UCLA Film and Television Archive / Billy Wilder Theater<br />
3 - 4:30pm<br />
$FREE / $8 / $9 / $10<br />
<em>In a reflexive mode, the filmmakers in this program contemplate their chosen medium, its history, defining characteristics and iconic movements. If there exists any Latin American specificity of meta-cinema, The Vampires of Poverty (Agarrando pueblo, 1977), by Luis Ospina and Carlos Mayolo, is one of the starting points of that tradition. It reflects on the representation of poverty in Latin America, produced by privileged local filmmakers and financed by European funders in search of the elusive &quot;real&quot; in Third World cinema. Ospina and Mayolo accompanied the 1978 Parisian premiere of The Vampires of Poverty with a manifesto entitled &quot;What is Poverty Porn?‚Äù, which represents a new level of self-awareness and critique surrounding the foreign perception of Latin American film. Ximena Cuevas‚Äô Cinepolis, la capital del cine (Cinepolis, the Film Capital, 2003) presents an insider‚Äòs unsettling perspective on the everyday world of image-making and image consumption.</em><br />

<p><strong>Plain Talk &amp; Common Sense (Uncommon Senses): A Film By Jon Jost</strong><br />
Echo Park Film Center<br />
8pm - 10pm<br />
$5<br />
<em>Plain Talk is a complex essay-film, a follow-up a decade and some years later to Speaking Directly, and so another State of the Nation discourse, made for Britain's Channel Four in the year 1986-87. The work involved extensive travel around the United States, and poses an examination of just what America is/was, or what do we mean when we speak of it. Done in a series of radically different sections which collide with each other in a manner intended to provoke thinking, Plain Talk, which was made by an American and intended for American viewers, was indeed broadcast in Britain, but somewhat predictably, not in the USA. FILMMAKER IN ATTENDANCE!</em><br />
