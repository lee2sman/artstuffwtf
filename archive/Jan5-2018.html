<p><strong>HANNAH EPSTEIN: MONSTER WORLD</strong><br />
Steve Turner Fine Arts<br />
6pm - 8pm<br />
<em>Steve Turner is pleased to present Monster World, a solo exhibition by Toronto-based Hannah Epstein that consists of a selection of brightly colored hooked rugs that depict a variety of monsters as imagined by the artist, whether derived from her study of folklore, her visual backlog of TV images, or from her interest in internet memes. A few years later Epstein learned how to make hooked rugs which has enabled her to use a traditional craft medium to become a folklorist in the Internet age. Epstein’s monsters, whether crazy cats, spooky hybrid animals, or a wild-eyed, shaved-headed Brittney Spears, remind us that monsters have long been lurking in the corners of our imagination.</em><br />

<p><strong>Closing: Omolara Abode – Chapter 7 Dankruptcy</strong><br />
Coaxial Arts<br />
7pm - 11pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Born in Lagos, raised in California, Omolara Abode has always been interested in visual storytelling, utilizing video as her medium. After a childhood spent experimenting with consumer-grade equipment, Omo (b. 1988, Lagos, Nigeria) expanded her technical expertise at UCLA's School of Theater, Film &amp; Television. Following many years of working in various aspects of the film &amp; TV industry, she attended a projection mapping workshop hosted by United VJs over a weekend at Art Share LA. This commenced a new avenue of creative endeavors, with an ever-growing roster of art galleries, music showcases, and theatrical productions that have featured her video installation and performance, under the stage moniker VIDEOMO. &quot;Chapter 7 Dankruptcy&quot; is the first solo exhibition curated by VIDEOMO. This show will utilize projectors, LED lights, video monitors and even a bioluminescence tank, in order to build out a fully immersive environment of art to view &quot;during a dry spell.&quot;</em><br />

<p><strong>Liquid Love</strong><br />
Gas (parked at The Pit)<br />
4 - 7pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Liquid Love brings together works that consider expressions of love, desire, and affection when these basic human needs are highly mediated and manipulated for profit by technological platforms. The show takes its title from sociologist Zygmunt Bauman’s 2003 book, where he argues that the logic of the capitalist market has thoroughly infiltrated the modern individual’s approach to relationships, as realized in everything from counseling fads to online dating. Citing widespread detachment and isolation, Bauman warns against the corrosive influence of consumerism on human bonds at all levels. By presenting a complicated picture of contemporary human connection, Liquid Love reflects on our ability to connect, romantically or otherwise, under neoliberal capitalism through and within our tools.</em><br />
