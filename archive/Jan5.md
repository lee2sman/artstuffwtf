Lots of great events this weekend. I am co-organizing the Wordhack West event Saturday. Let's stay in cahoots this year, LT

# FRI 1/6
**HOLLOWED EARTH: THE WORLD OF UNDERGROUND BUSINESS PARKS**  
The Center For Land Use Interpretation  
12pm - 5pm (Open Fridays - Sundays)   
FREE  
*They don't have openings at CLUI, so consider this your notice that a new exhibition is now open, Hollowed Earth: The World Of Underground Business Parks. The Center for Land Use Interpretation is a research and education organization interested in understanding the nature and extent of human interaction with the surface of the earth, and in finding new meanings in the intentional and incidental forms that we individually and collectively create. There is a vast network of underground office, storage, and logistics facilities in the former limestone mines of the USA. These drive-in artificial caves can extend for miles, and house a subterranean analog of the world above. Inside, millions of square feet have been paved, painted, wired, lighted, and walled into underground blocks of commercial real estate. .*

# SUN 1/8
**In Real Life: Performance, Bureau of Feminism**  
The Hammer Museum  
3pm - 5pm  
FREE  
*On the final weekend of her Hammer Project exhibition, Simone Leigh is joined by Rizvana Bradley, assistant professor of film and media studies and African-American studies at Yale, for a performative lecture. Leigh and Bradley will engage in an improvisational exchange about black radical political, literary, and artistic traditions. Inspired in part by the Black Panther Party’s community outreach focused on self-determination, Leigh’s recent work in social practice refers to historical instances where people, especially women of color, operated in secret to exchange knowledge, politically organize, and empower each other in the face of class and racial inequity.*

**Kathleen Johnson: Brainchild Part 4 - closing event for exhibition Radio Imagination: Artists In The Age Of Octavia Butler**  
Armory Center For The Arts  
4pm - 5pm  
FREE  
*Begun in 2008, Brainchild is Kathleen Johnson’s ongoing, nine-part collaborative fiction and sound project. For each successive part of her story, the artist collaborates with a different guest composer who creates a choral work for performance. Drawing on Johnson’s 15 years of experience in a close-knit science fiction reading group and passion for experimental music, Brainchild is simultaneously modest in tone and ambitious in scale, and still not halfway complete. For Brainchild, Part 4, presented at the Armory Center for the Arts, composer and multi-instrumentalist Laura Steenberge has created a layered a cappella score for the waning daylight of the Armory’s art studio space. Radio Imagination: Artists in the Archive of Octavia E. Butler is a group exhibition organized by the Los Angeles-based not-for-profit organization Clockshop. The exhibition debuts 6 new commissions inspired by the Octavia E. Butler papers at the Huntington Library. The exhibition is part of Clockshop’s year-long program throughout 2016 celebrating the life and work of Pasadena science fiction writer Octavia E. Butler (1947-2006).*
