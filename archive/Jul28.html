<p><strong>The Border Peepshow</strong><br />
12noon - 6pm<br />
The Velaslavasay Panorama<br />
$4 - 6 donation requested<br />
<em>The Border Peepshows depict scenes of the San Diego/Tijuana border from 1887, 1927, 1967, and 2017, drawing on historic and contemporary photographs of the region to illuminate the shifting story of a once culturally and ecologically connected terrain. A collaborative project between Parkeology, a public art program that excavates histories from urban parks, and The Velaslavasay Panorama, the Peepshows were first displayed in Balboa Park, in the Plaza de Panama, as an public exhibit in June 2017. The Peepshows will be on view during regular open hours at the Velaslavasay Panorama July 28th thru the 30th, 2017. Also, on view at the Velaslavasay Panorama since the summer of 2007, our Effulgence of the North arctic panorama will dematerialize into the ether to make way for a grand new 360-degree installation.</em><br />
