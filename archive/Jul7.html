<p><strong>Jon Clark: The New Games Tournament Relics - Opening &amp; Reception</strong><br />
Coaxial<br />
8pm - 11pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>The New Games Tournament points to an unknown subculture full of pomp and circumstance. Its members gain prestige via an implied athletic or theatrical performance. In reality, the narrative details reside only in the observer‚Äôs individual interpretation of the installation. The rules of the games themselves are unknown, and only evoked via ambiguous objects and imagery (including the equipment needed to play, and the trophies designating success or failure); yet the world of the tournament slowly expands with hints at characters and storylines made possible by their intersection with these artifacts. This exhibition condenses the essence of The New Games Tournament onto white canvases, placing various items (hardware, suburban home and garden fixtures, game pieces, sports equipment) onto tableaus that form an ephemeral collection of notable ‚Äúrelics‚Äù from the fictional sport.</em></p>

<p><strong>ACTION! PRESENTS COLLABORATION AND COCREATION IN DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKING</strong><br />
Echo Park Film Center<br />
12noon - 5pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>This workshop is free and open to young filmmakers ages 19 ‚Äì 35 with priority given to traditionally media-marginalized populations. Write us at info@echoparkfilmcenter.org for more info and sign up. Making documentaries surfaces power dynamics that can manifest and permeate documentaries in complex and unique ways. Documentary filmmakers are often aware of this dynamic and either accept it as is and move on, or leverage that awareness to push the documentary form. In this workshop, R.J. explores with workshop participants how filmmakers respond and navigate these dynamics and relationships to create challenging and compelling work.</em><br />
