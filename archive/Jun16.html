<p><strong>The Streets Have No Name For Us</strong><br />
Chantry Flats (RSVP for location)<br />
8am<br />
FREE with RSVP<br />
<em>Women were not meant to wander. There is no feminized form of ‚Äúfl√¢neur,‚Äù a term that began to embody a specific trope of idler Walter Benjamin shaped in the late 19th century; but if one were to put her French language skills to use, as the writer Lauren Elkin did, she could define the female urbanist as a ‚Äúfl√¢neuse.‚Äù Even today, in the seemingly liberated world women inhabit, it‚Äôs still a surprise for some to see a woman travel alone, go out to dance alone, drink alone, or backpack the Appalachian Trail alone. The fl√¢neuse operates in a different dimension as the fl√¢neur. She catches the sight of fading history, remnants of a gold rusher‚Äôs wood cabin, the stone foundation unearthed by Kristy Lovich on a hike through Chantry Flat.</em><br />
