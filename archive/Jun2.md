**Action! presents The Native and the Refugee**  
Echo Park Film Center  
8pm - 10pm   
FREE  
*The Native and the Refugee is a multimedia research project that investigates the space of Native reservations in the United States and Palestinian refugee camps in the Middle East. In connecting these two spaces and their struggles, the goals of the project are then to understand the centrality of the question of land and territory for any conception of autonomy; to look at the camp as an “extra-national” space with all the contradictions entailed and to meet with those getting organized politically in these places, and to understand their communal concerns. This screening is the kick-off event for ACTION! Cinema as Sanctuary, a free summer series presenting political documentary films and workshops. We Love Being Lakota (2015, 12 minutes, with Adam Khalil) The History of the Camp (2015, 10 minutes) Jenin (2017, 8 minutes) Indian Winter (2017, 26 minutes, with Vanessa Teran)*
