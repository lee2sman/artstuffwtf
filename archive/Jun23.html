FREE<br />
<em>A Series of Walks Led By Maryam Hosseinzadeh, Kristy Lovich, Betsy Melenbrink, and Erin Schneider, Curated by Ren√©e Reizman... Women were not meant to wander. There is no feminized form of ‚Äúfl√¢neur,‚Äù a term that began to embody a specific trope of idler Walter Benjamin shaped in the late 19th century; but if one were to put her French language skills to use, as the writer Lauren Elkin did, she could define the female urbanist as a ‚Äúfl√¢neuse.‚Äù Erin Schneider is an artist from Los Angeles, who likes sharing alternative geographies, histories, and experiences of place.</em><br />

<p><strong>The Four Fiscal Quarters</strong><br />
Pan Pacific Park (organized by Machine Project)<br />
8pm - 9pm<br />
FREE (RSVP recommended)<br />
<em>Join us for The Four Fiscal Quarters, an anti-capitalist opera that humanizes the cyclical nature of a corporate fiscal year. Following a crisis in the form of a layoff of 35% of a company, four C-Level officers struggle to hold it together. What kind of identity re-calibration, restructuring, and asset management is required to keep the company productive and successful? What unseen forces gave rise to the layoffs and how will the humanity of its workforce be balanced with the need for efficient productivity? Written and Directed by Zut Lorz, Composed by Vasco Cesaretti, Choreographed by Caitlin Adams, Conducted by Linnea Sablosky</em><br />
