<p><strong>La Collectionneuse presents: DAISIES Movie screening</strong><br />
Zebulon Cafe<br />
5pm DJ / 7:30pm screening<br />
FREE<br />
<em>La Collectionneuse presents: DAISIES. Dir. Vera Chytilov√°, 1966, digital presentation, 79 minutes. One of the most exhilarating stylistic and psychedelic eruptions of the 60s, this madcap and aggressive feminist farce by Vera Chytilova explodes in any number of directions. Two uninhibited young women engage in escapades that add up to less a plot than to a string of outrageous set pieces, including several antiphallic gags and a free-for-all with fancy food (rivaling Laurel and Hardy) that got Chytilova in lots of trouble with the authorities; disturbing yet liberating, it shows what this talented director can do with freedom. A major influence on Jacques Rivette's Celine and Julie Go Boating, this 1966 feature is chock-full of female giggling, which might be interpreted in context as the laughter of Medusa: subversive, bracing, energizing, and rather challenging to most male spectators. PRE-RECEPTION at 5pm with DJ LADY C (Dublab)</em><br />
