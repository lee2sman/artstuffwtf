<p><strong>They Live: Midnight screening</strong><br />
Nuart Theatre<br />
11:59PM<br />
$12<br />
<em>John Carpenter's THEY LIVE, 1 night only. SPOILER ALERT: Drifter &quot;John Nada&quot; finds construction work in Los Angeles and befriends fellow construction worker Frank Armitage, who leads him to a local shantytown soup kitchen. There, Nada encounters strange activity around the church: a blind preacher loudly chastising others to wake up, a police helicopter hovers overhead, and a drifter complains that his TV signal is continually interrupted by a man warning everyone about those in power. Nada discovers the nearby church is a front. The choir heard outside is an audio recording and the building is filled with scientific equipment and cardboard boxes. Nada finds a box hidden in the wall and finds it filled with sunglasses. Later he takes a pair and discovers the sunglasses have unique properties: they allow him to see that media and advertising hide omnipresent subliminal commands to obey, consume, reproduce, and conform. They also make clear that many people in positions of wealth and power are actually humanoid aliens with grotesque faces.</em><br />

<p><strong>Kcymaerxthaere Book Event at Arcana Books</strong><br />
Arcana Books on the Arts<br />
4pm - 6pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>From Hyperallergic: Eames Demetrios documents his elaborate parallel universe, Kcymaerxthaere, which currently has 133 historical markers in 27 countries across six continents. Artist, writer, and ‚Äúgeographer-at-large‚Äù Eames Demetrios has been exploring significant cultural sites around the globe for over a decade, from the Krblin Jihn Kabin in Joshua Tree, to the Crystals of Refrain in Armenia and Paglalagay ng Mensahe sa Buwan (The Way to the Moon) in the Phillipines. If you‚Äôre not familiar with these sites, you‚Äôre not alone. They belong not to our world, but to Kcymaerxthaere (pronounced ‚ÄúKy-mair-icks-theer‚Äù), a parallel universe created by Demetrios which has its own elaborate mythologies, stories, artifacts, and most impressively, historical markers, of which there are currently 133 in 27 countries across six continents. These range from conventional bronze plaques to more ambitious examples of public art like stone monuments, sited in barren stretches of wilderness, populated city centers, or even underwater. Located very much in the physical realm, they conjure up a fantastical world that bears similarities to our own, but is entirely fabricated, encouraging us to see our world through fresh eyes.</em><br />

Iris Sidikman is an experimental musician and installation artist. Her works encompass everything from freely improvised cello playing to performance and installation art, and address issues of community, grief, trauma and personal narrative. She is currently an MFA student in Experimental Sound Practices at California Institute of the Arts.</em><br />

$10<br />
<em>Strawberry Jam is a meetup to get stuff done in a group atmosphere among other devs and artists. Tired of working alone on your projects? Need some creative energy to zap into your process? Need some feedback? This is your chance! Please RSVP for a spot. We have limited seats available! We'll be accepting payment ($10) at the event. Bring your tools of choice (probably a laptop and a water bottle). Keep it light. We won't have enough space for things like roomscale VR, but single seat setups are OK. We'll start it off with a meet and greet at 12:30pm. There'll be some light refreshments, but getting lunch before hand is highly suggested. We'll then segue into working. Light chatting is fine, but Strawberry Jam is a work time and not just for hanging out. Afterwards there'll be an optional show and tell.</em><br />
