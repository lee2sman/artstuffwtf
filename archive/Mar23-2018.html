<p><strong>VOLUME + Human Resources Present Chris Duncan: 12 Symbols</strong><br />
Human Resources<br />
6pm - 9pm (additional gallery hours/performances throughout weekend)<br />
$?<br />
<em>12 SYMBOLS, composed by Chris Duncan, is an immersive sound performance and exhibition that metaphorically implicates the energy and patterns of the sun, moon, and the phenomenon of the eclipse to ponder our relationship to the passing of time. Cymbals become Symbols as 12 percussionists engage light, movement, and sound. The physical stage set by the initial performance of 12 SYMBOLS moves through phases throughout the course of the exhibition, welcoming a host of artists from Northern and Southern California alike in a series of performances. The exhibition and performances are dedicated to the loving memory of Paul Clipson, a light and love gone too soon.</em></p>

<p><strong>Architecture + Feminism - Editathon</strong><br />
2426 W Washington<br />
2pm - 6pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Architecture represents an important part of cultural production where gender trouble is even more pronounced than in other disciplines, professions, and fields. Wikipedia's content is skewed by the lack of female content and participation. This represents an alarming lack in an increasingly important repository of shared knowledge. Letâ€™s change that. Join us for a communal updating of Wikipedia entries on subjects related to architecture and feminism. We will provide tutorials for the beginner Wikipedian, reference materials, petcare, and refreshments. Bring your laptop, power cord and ideas for entries that need updating or creation. People of all gender identities and expressions are invited to participate.</em><br />

<p><strong>Art + Feminism 2018: Women + Film</strong><br />
Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)<br />
12pm - 5pm<br />
Free (with admission?)<br />
<em>Join LACMA and East of Borneo for a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and panel discussion addressing gender inequality in the film industry. Art and Feminism is a global campaign to improve the coverage of women and the arts on Wikipedia, the worldâ€™s online encyclopedia. A 2011 survey by the Wikimedia Foundation found that fewer than 10% of Wikipediaâ€™s editors identify as female, and its content is skewed by the lack of female participation. Letâ€™s change that. Beginners are welcome! The afternoon will kickoff with the panel discussion moderated by Dilcia Barrera, associate curator of film programs at LACMA at noon, followed by a Wikipedia training workshop at 2 pm to walk you step-by-step through the process of editing and creating new articles. Bring your own laptop and any books or other reference materials youâ€™d like to work from or share. You may also search LACMAâ€™s Balch Art Research Library catalog for additional resources.</em><br />
