<p><strong>Burea of Feminism: Telethon</strong><br />
The Hammer Museum<br />
3pm - 4pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>The Bureau of Feminism reaches out and touches someone today with Telethon. A logical progression from avant- and/or prankish '60s art actions, it's a performance staged for a live audience â€” a performance during which the Bureau calls people randomly and poses various questions about feminism. The ring tones, the dial tones and the overtones of confusion, surprise and hostility â€” they're all here, coming at you in a big, flaming ball that's actually a larger statement about feminism and the kaleidoscopic uncertainty about its significance by the public at large and down the line.</em><br />

<p><strong>The Films of Guy Debord</strong><br />
Cinefamily<br />
6:30pm<br />
$14<br />
<em>Olivier Assayas was 13 in May â€˜68. Growing up in the Paris of the 70s and precociously political, he was absorbed in the work of writer, filmmaker, and founding member of the Situationist International Guy Debord (notably, of La sociÃ©tÃ© du spectacle fame). Assayas presents two underrated and underseen films by Guy Debord: Critique de la separation and In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni.</em><br />
