<p><strong>Text Bath: Draft 1</strong><br />
3307 W Washington Blvd<br />
4pm - 6pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>3307 celebrates Fleurette West's installation and selected texts for the BOOKSHELVES program with a reception and performative reading. West's selected texts and corresponding installation, F-3307, are inspired by her on-going research on Eileen Gray, the Irish Modernist architect and furniture designer. Gray's titular home, E-1027, was defaced by a drunken, paintbrush-wielding Le Corbusier, an act that contributed to his narrative domination of her legacy. In Text Bath: Draft 1, West and 3307 director Amanda Katz perform a sonic layering of Gray's seminal interview with critic Jean Badovici (her then-lover) with passages from the current shelves. Text Bath: Draft 1 is at once a feminist re-telling of Grayâ€™s history and a public exploration of what the editing process for an audio publication could be.</em><br />

<p><strong>21 Ways To Describe Laughter</strong><br />
Machine Project<br />
8pm - 10pm<br />
FREE <em>Bits &amp; Bytes is a feminist AI project that employs design research and prototyping to explore the underlying bias that exists in concept, form, intent and behaviors assumed in the design of Artificial Intelligent systems. Bits and Bytes use collaborative creation to design for embodied intelligent experiences. Our first project, Sonified Plant Smiles (working title) utilizes plants and facial movement to engage in protest using intelligent interfaces. The lecture will highlight our critical design research approach to the disembodiment of the female, often seen in AI models and offer ways in which we may start to design for embodied experiences. Some of the work presented in the lecture will be from the group, and other work will reference other feminist AI projects. The Sound of an Effect imagines the future of labour where human and AI push the emotional and physical boundaries of one another.</em><br />
