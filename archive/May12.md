$9  
*Chris Burden guaranteed his place in art history in the 1970s with a series of often dangerous and at times stomach-churning performances. After having himself shot, confined to a locker for five days, electrocuted, and crucified on the back of a VW bug, Burden reinvented himself as a creator of truly mesmerizing installations and sculptures, from a suspended gigantic flywheel that seemingly spins on its own to an assemblage of antique streetlights rewired for solar energy and illuminated outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In the documentary Burden, filmmakers Timothy Marrinan and Richard Dewey look at the artist’s works and private life with an innovative mix of still-potent videos of his ‘70s performances, personal videos and audio recordings of friends, fellow students, colleagues and critics, and latter-day footage at Burden’s Topanga Canyon studio, all peppered with the artist’s thoughts and musings through the years.*

**Breathe in the World, (or, problems with you, me, we, they, hear and see)**  
The Hammer Museum  
4 - 5pm (Saturday and Sunday)  
FREE  
*This new performance is concerned with the movement of breath in and out of the body through the vector of a new instrument as the primary catalyst. This instrument splits the breath’s production of sound through analog loops as well as a series of temperature sensors that create independent sound based on data. Three musicians improvise with the single instrument, illustrating the symbiotic connection of the body with its surroundings, analog and digital, communication and chaos. The performance is also an examination of the internal’s constant negotiation of external life through language, musicality, mis/connections, labor, and material, all wrought with some humor through fear.*
