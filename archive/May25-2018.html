<p><strong>The Future Left Reading Group: Inventing The Future</strong><br />
Universal Research Group<br />
2pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Inventing The Future is a landmark work of contemporary social and political commentary that has, since its publication in 2015, reset the course of activism on the Left and inspired a wave of futureward political organizing‚Äî our own group, The Future Left, among them. Srnicek and Williams challenge the effectiveness of hyperlocalized ‚Äúfolks politics‚Äù for tackling complex, global issues, such as climate change, multinational capitalism, rapid technological innovation, or the erosion of the nation-state. They also explain the limitations of any horizontal politics, of the kind we saw during #OccupyWallStreet, that takes ‚Äúresistance‚Äù as its primary strategy.</em><br />
