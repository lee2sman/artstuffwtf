<em>Manifesto features two-time Academy Award-winner Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine, The Aviator) in thirteen astonishing roles that span the gamut of humanity. Six years in the making, the film is a collaboration between Blanchett and writer/director Julian Rosefeldt, an acclaimed visual artist who, before turning Manifesto into a feature-length film, debuted the project as a video art installation. From punk rocker to anchorwoman interviewing herself as reporter at a remote location, from homeless man to mother delivering Sunday grace before family dinner, from puppeteer to factory worker, a chameleon-like Blanchett gives a tour-de-force performance as she transforms herself as never before, rising to the challenge as few actresses could. Filmed on many striking locations, staged with ironic contrasts and even sly humor, the film incorporates heartfelt manifestos from 20th century art and philosophy movements‚ÄîFuturists, Dadaists, Pop Art, Dogma 95, Fluxus artists, Suprematists, Situationists and many others‚Äîweaving together history‚Äôs most impassioned artistic statements in a stunning and contemporary call to action.</em><br />
