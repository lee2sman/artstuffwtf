		<h1>ðŸ‘¹ <a href="http://artstuff.wtf">ARTSTUFF.WTF</a></h1>
<p>I started Artstuff.wtf because I was looking for low-cost events and to expand my community in LA, and wanted a way to share what I've found. I've now been operating Artstuff.wtf for over a year. Thanks to everyone that reads and suggests events. I'm very open to ideas and comments. One note on my politics: I won't be listing events that are all-male lineups of speakers or performers. Thanks.-Lee</p>

<p><strong>Vision Valley | Opening Reception</strong><br />
Brand Library and Art Center<br />
6pm - 9pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Conceived and organized by The Pit, an artist-run gallery located on Ruberta Street in Glendale, Vision Valley features work by 32 artists in mediums including painting, sculpture, drawing, printmaking, video, photography, and film. Adam D. Miller and Devon Oder founded The Pit in 2014, opening the project space in the same building that has housed their studios since 2011. Recognizing the significant number of artists whose studios were located along San Fernando Road--the major thoroughfare that is adjacent to the gallery and which also connects Glendale and Los Angeles--the inaugural exhibition at The Pit comprised works made by artists with studios along the busy street. That first exhibition set the stage for The Pitâ€™s ongoing experiment in building a community of artists and friends. There are no conceptual, political, or philosophical themes upon which this exhibition turns, and it does not claim to distill a particular trend, aesthetic, or idea. Though most of the artists in the exhibition are currently active in Glendale, the exhibition includes a significant bit of history through the inclusion of Edward Weston. First visiting Glendale (then known as Tropico) in 1906, Weston subsequently set up a photography studio in Glendale in 1910. Vision Valley offers a diverse selection of works that are part of an ongoing, dynamic multilogue between artists living or working in a specific geographical area and aims to showcase the many coincidental visions at work in the valley known as Glendale.</em><br />
