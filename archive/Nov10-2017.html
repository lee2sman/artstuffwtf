<em>PRAXIS is a series of exhibitions and monthly conversations with media artists, curated by PhD students in the Division of Media Arts + Practice. The program brings together members of LA's experimental design community to engage in a discourse about future cinema and design practice at the edges of the field. This month's PRAXIS celebrates the recent publication of 3-D Printed Body Architecture (Wiley). This volume, co-edited by MA+P PhD candidate Behnaz Farahi and architect/theorist Neil Leach, focuses on 3-D printing as a method for the design and fabrication of wearable, body-scale objects.</em><br />

<p><strong>New Works Salon XLI</strong><br />
Echo Park Film Center<br />
8pm - 10pm (doors 7:30pm) $5<br />
<em>The New Works Salons series is a casual forum for the presentation and discussion of new works in film, video, sound, and performance, with local and visiting artists often in-person to introduce their work. This, the forty-first program in the series, will include Luciano Piazza‚Äôs new 16mm film Las Vegas in 16 Parts, Janis Crystal Lipzin's new video Las Manos, and two short works by Eric Franco Aguilar. Piazza says Las Vegas in 16 Parts: ‚ÄúI explore the endless spectacle of an organic machine fed with fear and desire. It is a film constructed upon documentary images that aspire to become a fiction of an invented city. My gaze oscillated between the point of view of the scriptwriter of the simulacrum and the point of view of those who live in the simulacrum. Instead of trying to extract from Vegas a model to critique our ‚Äúconnectivity to the real‚Äù, I consider Vegas a ‚Äúliquid ever-changing mirror.‚Äù I am fascinated with the bittersweet desire to belong to something, to be a significant part of the tradition that will narrate history, to find our reflection in a shining symbol.‚Äù The program will include several other short films TBA.</em><br />

<p><strong>Overcrossings book launch + panel</strong><br />
Los Angeles Contemporary Archive<br />
2pm - 4pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Overcrossings Project was a series of three happenings on three pedestrian overcrossings above the Interstate-110 Arroyo Seco Freeway during summer 2016. The project culminates with a book launch and panel discussion at Los Angeles Contemporary Archive (LACA). The I-110, celebrated as the world‚Äôs first freeway, has cut a wall through the communities of Chinatown, Cypress Park, Highland Park, and South Pasadena. In an attempt to provide safe access across these inhuman spaces, pedestrian overcrossings both accommodate and cage the body. Sixteen artists and two collectives engaged with each site and its surrounding communities through performances, temporary installations, writing, and print-specific projects for the publication. In this alienating maze of concrete and vehicles, how do we inhabit the paths built for walking? Panel moderated by Harry Gamboa Jr.</em><br />
