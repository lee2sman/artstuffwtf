#SAT
**Rallying With Chance: Matthias Dorfeldt**  
688 S Santa Fe Ave, #112  
7pm - 10pm  
FREE  
*Rallying With Chance shows Matthias Dörfelt's most recent man machine collaborations that explore the expressive potential of instruction based art through the lens of drawing. In his work, Dörfelt is following the trajectory of chance induced art practices from the last century, using custom software and processes to bounce ideas off of randomness at eye level. Instead of looking for any notion of objectivity, he does so in order to amplify personal bias, weirdness and expressivity as he thinks that this kind of interaction with computers, machines and technology will point towards the future development of artificial intelligence and human machine interaction.*

The Museum of Jurassic Technology  
7:30pm (a second set begins at 9:30pm)  
$15 / $12 members,students  
*Craig Ventresco plays a repertoire of songs from the brief but fecund era of acoustically recorded music. Like Fred Van Eps -- the gifted banjoist who recorded hundreds of cylinders and 78 rpm records between 1897 and 1927 -- who mastered his instrument by listening to earlier recordings, Mr. Ventresco has developed a repertoire of songs learned by listening to wax cylinders and shellac records of the acoustic era. For over twenty years, San Franciscans have heard Craig Ventresco’s evocative guitar playing on street corners and in cafes. He has performed and recorded with Bo Grumpus and Janet Klein, and is well known for his extensive contributions to the soundtrack to the documentary CRUMB. Mr. Ventresco plays guitar, banjo, ukelele, and mandolin, often with the accompaniment of singer Meredith Axelrod.*
