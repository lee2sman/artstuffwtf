**[Artstuff.wtf](http://artstuff.wtf)** is a weekly email with a few recommendations for art, music and cultural events in LA. There is now a minimal (alpha version) website for easy access and archive of past announcements.

*Editor's Note: I particularly enjoyed the Henry Taylor exhibit that closes Saturday. One of the more interesting (and provocative) exhibits I've seen in a commercial gallery in LA in a bit.*

#FRI 11/04
**Henry Taylor (exhibition closes Saturday)**  
Blum and Poe  
Friday and Saturday (*editor's note: there is a 'performance' i believe throughout the day Saturday only that added a lot to my enjoyment of the exhibit Saturday*)  
10am-6pm  
FREE  
*Taylor’s work continues to delve and expand upon the language of portraiture and painting, while also pointing to the social and political issues affecting African Americans today. From racial inequality, homelessness, and poverty, to the importance of family and community, Taylor says, “My paintings are what I see around me…they are my landscape paintings.” Taylor marks the disparity between social classes from one gallery to the next by installing in each space a distinct terrain. An empty, dirt lot beside a lush, grassy lawn inevitably points to the different groups of people who inhabit these spaces. While one space portrays a certain sense of abandon and despair, the other is more about experiencing pleasure and comfort within private property. The subjects in the paintings vary – from scenes of Taylor’s life to imagery inspired by current affairs, candidly depicting the world around him.*

Coaxial Gallery

*Interspecies wrestlers both good and bad compete for the title of Ultimate Multi-Universal Warrior in the latest production by Telefantasy Studios. Jennifer Juniper Stratford established Telefantasy Studios in 2004 to create mind melting mutant video and Television experiences. Scavenging the ruins of the post-digital-apocalypse, JJ hunts down analog broadcast equipment cast off from Hollywood studios. This treasured hardware is then redeployed to create innovative and original new programming, often in alliance with some of the multiverse’s brightest stars to create cult classic public access programs, highly sought-after sim-sense chips, video experiments and music videos which invite you to turn on, jack in and rock out.*

#SUN 11/6
**Jack Smith Rushes/ Dirty Looks Los Angeles**  
Human Resources  
7:30pm - 9:30pm

*Jack Smith scholar Josh Lubin-Levy will introduce never-before-seen 8mm film rushes and improvised compositions, featuring Mario Montez, Tally Brown and Smith, alongside his short film ‘I Was A Male Yvonne DeCarlo’ (1967 - 1970s). Ranging from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, the featured films present a glimpse into significant period of Smith’s career in which his work began to turn from photography and film towards live performance. Organized in conjunction with Barbara Gladstone Gallery.*

**Cellphone Theater**  
Coaxial  
7:30pm - 9:30pm

*The point of the event is to celebrate technology being more widely available, thus introducing new voices to film, and that every film is made entirely on cellphones and includes some debut filmmakers.*
