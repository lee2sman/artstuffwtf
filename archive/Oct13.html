A related publication complements the exhibition with content such as interviews, texts, and images generated through the deep research process, which has unfolded over the past four years. Please join us for the opening reception featuring a special DJ performance by Sonido Apokalitzin.</em><br />

<p><strong>Ryoji Ikeda's A [for 100 cars] - RBMA L.A.</strong><br />
Downtown LA<br />
4pm - 7pm (doors: 3pm)<br />
FREE with RSVP<br />
<em>The renowned audiovisual artist presents the world’s largest synth orchestra. As part of Red Bull Music Academy Festival Los Angeles, renowned artist Ryoji Ikeda will present a brand-new composition, in collaboration with 100 automobile owners, that constitutes the world’s largest synth orchestra. The piece, entitled A [for 100 cars] will continue Ikeda’s long-running series investigating the frequencies of note A. Before the world settled on the general tuning standard of A=440Hz, there were historically many different standards. A [for 100 cars], performed by emitting sine waves at all these diverse (yet specific) frequencies, will create an immersive soundscape. RBMA’s Tatsuya Takahashi will work with Ikeda to create a device, especially for this performance, that will help guide the composition from start to finish.</em><br />
