  <em>Please save the date for Saturday, October 28th, and Sunday, October 29th, 2017, for the Seventh Los Angeles Anarchist Bookfair at Leimert Park Village! Please join us as we relaunch this radical space for discussion and organizing. As members of the Book Fair Collective, we believe it is essential to express protest and rebellion against the highly authoritarian capital-State system that by its very nature offers nothing more than endless war, vast social inequality, and utter ecological ruin. We seek to promote solidarity and unity among the various communities in struggle of Los Angeles, Southern California, and the occupied region of the U.S. Southwest. We have two themes for the Book Fair this year: ‚ÄúRed and Black October: Revisiting the ‚ÄòUnknown‚Äô Anarchist Revolution of 1917 A Century Later,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrom the Media to the Streets: Against the Resurgence of the Alt-Right.‚Äù Check the link for FULL SCHEDULE of workshops.</em><br />

  Pretend Gallery<br />
  12pm - 6pm<br />
  FREE<br />
  <em>&quot;Laundromat Book Club&quot; with new functional ceramic work by Shoshi Kanokohata. Pretend Gallery‚Äôs washer and dryer set are from Electrolux's Gallery Series. It‚Äôs a commercial, heavy duty, super capacity machine with a Sound Silencer Plus and a ¬æ horsepower motor. We're not sure if that‚Äôs good, but we‚Äôve only needed the belts changed once in four years. The washer has made a loud high pitch screech about half way through its cycle, and again towards the end, ever since. Otherwise it works fine. Bring your laundry. No need to bring quarters. The laundry detergent we use is biodegradable and dye and perfume free. We also use unscented fabric softener sheets. Bring a book you would read at a laundromat. Pretend Gallery is open this year every Sunday from noon to 6pm for a year-long project called &quot;Now Open&quot;, an open system art event and store with work by local and international artists. Laundromat Book Club is part of this broader project. It began January 1 and ends December 31st 2017.</em><br />
