Machine Project<br />
8:30pm (Thurs - Sun)<br />
$20 - 40<br />
<em>In a troubled world not unlike our own, two lizard-men tumble from the sky to an abandoned jetty by the sea. Inhabited only by a sad sack cyclops, a satanic bird, and a sexy snail, the jetty becomes a raunchy boysâ€™ room, an Edenic dope yard of pleasure and sick until one dayâ€¦Daddyâ€™s home. Soon hazy memories of war, incest, and a parricide fracture the minds of gods and animals and the humans cloaked within them. Smelly, crusty, and full of slime, Sorry, Atlantis, Edenâ€™s Achinâ€™ Organ Seeks Revenge is a comedy about childhood wounds, sexual repression, and the lure of power. Come hide your face from human-sized sea monkeys, trained flies, gushing holes, and sundry mindless lewdities. Wear your rain rubbers! Disclaimer: This play is definitely, totally, and absolutely for adults only</em><br />
