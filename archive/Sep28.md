$20 - 40  
*In a troubled world not unlike our own, two lizard-men tumble from the sky to an abandoned jetty by the sea. Inhabited only by a sad sack cyclops, a satanic bird, and a sexy snail, the jetty becomes a raunchy boys’ room, an Edenic dope yard of pleasure and sick until one day…Daddy’s home. Soon hazy memories of war, incest, and a parricide fracture the minds of gods and animals and the humans cloaked within them. Smelly, crusty, and full of slime, Sorry, Atlantis, Eden’s Achin’ Organ Seeks Revenge is a comedy about childhood wounds, sexual repression, and the lure of power.  Come hide your face from human-sized sea monkeys, trained flies, gushing holes, and sundry mindless lewdities. Wear your rain rubbers!  Disclaimer: This play is definitely, totally, and absolutely for adults only*
