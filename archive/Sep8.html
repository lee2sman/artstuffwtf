<p><strong>Discipline: The Art Of Psychic TV, 2003 ‚Äì 2016 exhibit</strong><br />
Lethal Amounts<br />
8pm - 11pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Psychic TV (sometimes spelled Psychick TV), or PTV, is an English experimental video art and music group, formed by performance artist Genesis P-Orridge and video director Peter Christopherson after the break-up of Throbbing Gristle. In 2003, New York artist and musician Edley ODowd gently persuaded friend Genesis Breyer P-Orridge to rekindle h/er desire to perform and create music as Psychic TV. The result has been a 14 year run of concerts and releases as Psychic TV / PTV3. Nearly all of the graphics for the ensuing album packaging, t-shirts and ephemera, for the now longest-running version of Psychic TV in history, have been designed by ODowd.</em><br />

Echo Park Film Center<br />
1pm - 5pm<br />
$50 / 60<br />
<em>Participants will learn to make motion pictures and looping sound with a very economical tool: simple adhesive tape! We will make eye-popping ‚Äúmoving collages‚Äù using a dye transfer technique from magazine pages onto 16mm film, then segue into making our own cassette tape loops, splicing by hand and re-recording onto them. The workshop will include a presentation on the history of using everyday materials for art making, direct animation and audio tape loops. Participants will leave at the end of the day with their very own 16mm collage film and reusable audio cassette tape loop. Workshop limited to 9 participants.

<p><strong>Ruben Ochoa: Sampled y Surveyed</strong><br />
Art + Practice<br />
2pm - 4pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Oceanside-born, Los Angeles-based artist Ruben Ochoa‚Äôs practice, like that of a land surveyor‚Äôs, engages space as both a concept and a collection of material forms that structure human life. The first part of the exhibition gathers key large-scale works, each produced through a specific construction tactic‚Äîextraction, framing, obstruction, reinforcement. Collectively, these works structure and manipulate the way bodies move‚Äîshedding light on the often concealed intentions that give way to the spaces people inhabit and navigate through in their daily lives. The second part of the exhibition, envisioned like a drafting room, focuses on the lives and conditions of materials. Bringing together a selection of rubbings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, and installations, this part of the exhibition explores how materials themselves are imbued with charged histories as a result of their making, their use, and the economies in which they circulate. When put to the service of construction, what Ochoa shows us are the sociopolitical, economic, and cultural differences inherent in the physical makeup of the environments people exist in and the possibility of an expanded definition of place, locality, landscape, territory, city, and more broadly, geography</em><br />

<p><strong>drone of perseus</strong><br />
HILDE<br />
6pm - 10pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>How long into the future will our language exist? Across the universe, in a place where no matter or radiation can escape, sings the cluster of Perseus. At 57 octaves below middle C, this lonely hero drones at a frequency of 10 million years, imperceptible to the human ear. Each great society has a history of being born, flourishing, crumbling, and dying. Certainly, we must attempt to touch our distant future as we follow our fate. Can artists create a new language which can withstand societal breakdowns and natural or anthropogenic disasters? What should they say? Abandoning the alpha-numeric and emoji-ridden language of our time, these artists rely on tone, color, material, geometry, and sound (or lack thereof) to communicate to the thick darkness of an unknown future.

<p><strong>The Last Artic Show</strong><br />
The Velaslavasy Panorama<br />
8pm<br />
$30 / $35<br />
<em>On view at the Velaslavasay Panorama since the summer of 2007, our Effulgence of the North arctic panorama will dematerialize into the ether to make way for a grand new 360-degree installation. A retirement party is planned for the evening of September 9th. A variety of acts will celebrate this monumental panorama. Any and all proceeds from this event will go towards installing the next panorama: Shenjing Panorama. For ten winters and eleven summers, Effulgence of the North has been a smudge of ashen fluff on the shores of L.A., up to 34-degrees north latitude and 118-degrees west. The first hour of SATURDAY under SATURN, the ship sails gallantly, leaving white foam spray like a furrow behind her. 15 Acts perform 5 minutes each! The first and last ever variety show dedicated to the retirement of an artic panorama.</em><br />
