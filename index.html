		<h1>ðŸ‘¹ <a href="http://artstuff.wtf">ARTSTUFF.WTF</a></h1>

<p>Hi friends, this week I wanted to share some bittersweet news. <a href="http://artstuff.wtf">Artstuff.wtf</a> as a weekly listing site/email list for DIY art and music (etc) list will be ending next month. I am moving to New York where I've accepted a professorship position at Purchase College (SUNY Purchase). I began Artstuff.wtf as &quot;Weekend Events&quot; in October 2016, to share Los Angeles events that looked interesting and to find friends to join me. I'll be continuing to post and email weekly until I leave at the end of July 2018. I'm thinking about posting a list of DIY art and music orgs and venues worthy of attention and exploration or will turn this into something else. I'm open to your ideas. Warmly, Lee</p>

<p><strong>Modular On The Spot</strong><br />
North Atwater Park<br />
3:30pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>&quot;Modular on the Spot&quot; is a nomadic feast in the physical sense of the word: a monthly performance held at an outdoor location in Los Angeles. The location is revealed a couple of days in advance where modular synthesists -- aided only by a generator and a sound system -- come together for an evening of electronic music. The performance concept adheres to three strict rules: always outside, always free and artists are required to use only modular synths during their performance. Performances this month by Omnichord, Carianoff, Bryan Curt Kosters, Carlos Colon, JStory</em><br />

<p><strong>Accessioning Access: Social Reflexivity within Archival Practice</strong><br />
3307 W Washington<br />
4pm - 6pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>This conversation celebrates the closing of Ann Harezlak's participatory reading environment, &quot;An Archive-in-Residence,&quot; created for her BOOKSHELVES residency at 3307 W Washington Blvd. Jessica Gambling, Museum Archivist at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Karly Wildenhaus, arts researcher and library worker, and Amanda Martin Katz, artist, writer and organizer of 3307 W Washington Blvd, will provide a range of viewpoints on social reflexivity within archival practice. Moderated by Ann Harezlak (Digital Art Humanities Research Assistant, Getty Research Institute). Following from Ann Harezlak's reading environment &quot;An Archive-in-Residence,&quot; created for her 3307 BOOKSHELVES residency, this panel discussion will explore relationships between authority, organization and user-ship within emerging archival practices. As the way information is organized informs how it is comprehended, what are the responsibilities of archivists and other history-makers in writing socially reflexive public narratives? How does organization determine user-ship, and how can archival systems be open to culturally-informed lexical shifts in their vocabularies? Who are we archiving for?</em><br />
