<p>Local forecast: hot. Just a bittersweet reminder that Artstuff.wtf will be shutting down in a week as I'm relocating to NY for a new job. I'll post a last time next weekend and then create a hopefully useable list of artstuff.wtf spaces for good art, music, experiences at that time.-Lee</p>

<em>We are so excited and honored to have the legendary and mysterious Los Angeles based Artist GX Jupitter-Larsen as our next ARTIST IN RESIDENCE! &quot;Friends About The Polywave is a multidimensional answer to a hypothetical question. How does one measure one‚Äôs community? By the relationships we grow up with? By the names of those we‚Äôve met along the way? What names act as inches in the meter that is your life?&quot;</em><br />

<p><strong>Sarah Rara - Alias has been postponed to 7/15 due to heatwave.</strong><br>
<s>Human Resources<br />
3pm - 6pm (also on view Sunday July 8th 12-6, and Weds-Sun 12-6 through July 15th)<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Human Resources presents Alias, an exhibition of new video work by Los Angeles-based artist Sarah Rara. Rara‚Äôs multi-disciplinary practice‚Äîincuding performance, writing, and video‚Äîexplores the position of witness within fragile systems. For Alias, Rara focuses on a characteristic distortion of sampled images‚ÄîAliasing‚Äîwhere one grid fails to cleanly capture another, and separate entities become indistinguishable. One form ingesting another, a parasite larger than its host: Alias is a story about solar energy, ruined by observation.</em><br />
