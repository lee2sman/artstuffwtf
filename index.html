		<p><strong>Decentralizing The Web: Screening 002 - Lumapit Sa Akin, Paraiso</strong><br />
		UCLA Broad Arts Center, EDA<br />
		7pm<br />
		FREE<br />
		<em>DECENTRALIZING THE WEB presents a screening of LUMAPIT SA AKIN, PARAISO + artist talk on female domestic labor, gendered migration, and science fiction featuring director Stephanie Comilang. Lumapit Sa Akin, Paraiso (Come to Me Paradise) is a science fiction documentary by Stephanie Comilang that uses the backdrop of Hong Kong and the various ways in which the Filipina migrant worker occupies Central on Sundays. The film is narrated from the perspective of Paraiso, a ghost played by a drone who speaks of the isolation from being uprooted and thrown into a new place. Paraisoâ€™s reprieve comes when she is finally able to interact with the women and feel her purpose, which is to transmit their vlogs, photos, and messages back home. During the week she is forced back into isolation and is left in an existential rut.</em><br />

	 <p><strong>Theaster Gates: But To Be A Poor Race</strong><br />
 	Regen Projects<br />
 	6pm - 8pm reception. Conversation between Theaster Gates and curator Hamza Walker Sunday at 2pm<br />
 	FREE<br />
 	<em>Gates is internationally renowned for his cross-disciplinary practice that spans sculpture, painting, sound, and performance. Featuring all new works, many of which will be created on site, this exhibition marks the artistâ€™s continued investigation into the relationship between visual politics, shamanism, and object making. The title of the exhibition refers to American sociologist and civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Boisâ€™ seminal work The Souls of Black Folk. Comprised of 14 essays that portray the genius and humanity of the Black race, this publication is considered an important work in sociology and African American literary history. Inspired by Du Boisâ€™ sociological studies on the advancements of Black Americans from the time of Emancipation to 1900, the exhibition will feature a series of response paintings in which the statistical data gathered and made visual by Du Bois has been reduced to abstract color fields and geometric motifs. Both an act of homage to Du Boisâ€™ sophisticated Modernism as well as a reference to the history of art, Gatesâ€™ paintings give poetic form to the archival. Also on view will be the debut of a new video work entitled Sweet Land of Liberty. Depicting a performance featuring Gates and the experimental music ensemble The Black Monks of Mississippi. Serving as a marking point of artistic and formal reflection, the sculptures, paintings, and video on view in the exhibition present Gatesâ€™ recent inquiries into the role of painting, history making, the power of material culture, and the polemics of patriotism.</em><br />
