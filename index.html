The procession returns to a courtyard convening enlivened by the music of Miya Folick. On Sunday, Schnitger further explores feminist speech by inviting filmmaker Kerri Koch to share her work, Donâ€™t Need You: A Herstory of Riot Grrrl; followed by a screening of Inez Milholland: Forward Into Light, a short film by Martha Wheelock on the preeminent suffragette; and a talk on contemporary witchcraft and closing ceremony by Amanda Yates Garcia, the Oracle of Los Angeles.</em><br />

<p><strong>DIY Art School</strong> Women's Center For Creative Work<br />
12pm<br />
$25 members/$30 non-members<br />
<em>The DIY Art School program is interested in a radical shift from contemporary education that currently exists, one that funnels creators, activists, educators, thinkers and/or artists through higher education programs leaving them in debt and with little resources to feel supported in creatively expressing themselves. Our programs seek to provide support and understanding of a creative process that comes from within and is generative in its approach. To us, this is a radical shift. We believe radical education and creative process is aligned with intuitive process and community love. This program will explore the mission, goals, and teachings of the DIY Art School program. Participants will also find what their own DIY Art School path is. DIY Education is Sarita Dougherty, David Whitaker of DIY PhD and Rebekah Erev of DIY Art School Bay Area.</em><br />
