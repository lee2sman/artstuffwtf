	 <p><strong>item idem's NUII film + discussion</strong><br />
	 8pm screening / 9pm discussion<br />
	 Bethlehem Baptist Church (501(c)3 Foundation)<br />
	 FREE<br />
	 <em>Following in the footsteps of JOSS (2014, 6 min.) directed in collaboration with Chinese artist &amp; filmmaker, NUlI expands upon the cathartic promise of ritualization. Just as JOSS depicted the fiery destruction of Chinese funeral ritual paper objects related to contemporary images of wealth, NUII explores the dark dyonisian rapture of blowing up PiÃ±atas crafted as corporate logos, political figures, as well as sectarian and terrorist organizations. On the day of the inauguration of the first ever American president who comes entirely from the private sector and who brings with him advisers and policy-makers who are also mostly high-earning finance world executives with as little experience in government and public service as the president himself --- a new president who takes office with record low approval ratings -- this panel of curators, artists, architects and activists come together to assimilate this moment in history to offer and recipricate progressive, supportive and indulgent reactions from both speaker and viewer. Out of Absentia is an opportunity for LA cultural producers to thwart the art and culture strike that many individuals and institutions have bound themselves to on this critical day in our political history. Instead, we want to begin on the very day that this controversial new president is sworn into office, the long path forward in opposition to the inevitable corporate greed and unfairness that will shape much of American policy over the next four years. This talk welcomes discussion of, expressing anger at, brainstorming for, and publicly grieving the loss of decency to which the election of Trump signals.</em><br />

	 <p><strong>Exhibition Reception: Jane The Baptist</strong><br />
	 Five Car Garage<br />
	 5pm - 8pm<br />
	 FREE<br />
	 <em>Jane is a sci-fi-techno-ecstatic voyage through the birth canals of modern automated car washes within Los Angeles County. The view is myopic, brutal, and candy lush with frothy synthetic ooze delivered by an attentive robotic hand. It is unending and internal, providing a transcendent passage to the extraordinary in the mundane. The original musical score from Miguel de Pedro /Kid606 delivers an accompanying tone that is dizzying, with both ascending and descending flavor. Together it is a world gone mad but simultaneously beautiful and hypnotic, like a drive down the Sunset Strip. It is, and it will be a good ride.</em><br />
