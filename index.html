	 <p><strong>Solid States opening reception</strong><br />
	 Coaxial Arts<br />
	 8pm (Additional events held Sat and Sun - see link)<br />
	 FREE<br />
	 <em>The first immersive art experience from longtime collaborators Alex Pelly and Elaine Carey, Solid States emerged from the desire to combine experiments in interactive video and auditory phenomena in an intermedia, site-specific artwork. In this examination of unyielding structure and malleability, Pelly and Carey will explore textures of metal hardware through a collection of sculptures. Pellyâ€™s video work will capture the form and movement of each element. The same materials will be used to create Careyâ€™s accompanying soundscapes. Each fixture will be installed in a different area of the gallery, forming an environment that alters depending on the viewerâ€™s location within the space, as they perceive a varying blend of light and sound.</em><br />

	 <p><strong>How To Fight Like A Girl</strong><br />
	 Echo Park Film Center<br />
	 8pm (doors 7:30)<br />
	 $5<br />
	 <em>How To Fight Like A Girl is a look inside a playful, political, gorgeous, ugly, queer-minded aesthetic. These artistsâ€™ film, video, and new media works call to glitter bomb the pigs, wrangle the bourgeois with pink lassoâ€™s, and drown the misogynists in play-doh spaghetti. Using tropes of theater, puppetry, drag, kitsch, and horror intertwined with fiercely intelligent social, political, and personal observations, these artists are paving out a current and important aesthetic like no other. The program includes works by A.J. McClenon, Joey Scher, Kelly Gallagher, Liz Cambron, Molly Hewitt, Zachary Hutchinson and Hannah Piper Burns. Curator Emily Eddy in attendance.</em><br />

	 <p><strong>Ivanka Loves Refugees (performance)</strong><br />
	 P0ST<br />
	 7pm - 10pm<br />
	 FREE<br />
	 <em>A silk scarf colored with deep ruby explosions. Light, soft and now wrinkled, its border is a boring peach hue. The whole thing looks like a beautiful spill. My motherâ€™s accidental acquisition of this garment five years ago brought it into our lives. Forbidden to wear and yet not-quite-trash, what would we do with an Ivanka Trump scarf? NOTE: This performance will coincide with the opening of two new contemporary art spaces at the Bendix Building, Monte Vista Projects and Tiger Strikes Astroid.</em><br />

	 <p><strong>Art and Feminism Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon</strong><br />
	 LACMA | Art and Technology Lab<br />
	 11am - 4pm<br />
	 FREE<br />
	 <em>Art and Feminism is a campaign to improve the coverage of women and the arts on Wikipedia. A 2011 survey by the Wikimedia Foundation found that fewer than 10% of Wikipediaâ€™s editors identify as female, and its content is skewed by the lack of female participation. Join East of Borneo for a Wikipedia workshop to help bridge that gender gap. Beginners are welcome! Training for new Wikipedia editors will be offered at 11 am and 1 pm. Bring your own laptop and any reference materials youâ€™d like to work from or share. You may also search LACMAâ€™s Balch Art Research Library catalog for additional resources.</em><br />
