<p><strong>Performing Radical Fictions</strong><br />
California African-American Museum<br />
7pm - 10pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>This evening of &quot;radical fiction&quot; features an original, community-based performance along the lines of Theatre of the Oppressed‚Äîa technique that uses theater to promote social and political change‚Äîto explore how false notions of race, class, gender, and national origin are being used as tools of exploitation and oppression. The program is presented in conjunction with the 2018 Institute for Theatre &amp; Social Change conference and is followed by a production of Branden Jacobs-Jenkins's An Octaroon, directed by Anita Dashiell-Sparks, which the New York Times called ‚Äúthis decade‚Äôs most eloquent theatrical statement on race in America today.‚Äù</em><br />

<p><strong>Pauline Gloss: Lullabies for the Psychotic and Other Recent Work</strong><br />
Human Resources<br />
7:30pm - 11pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Literary sound-artist Pauline Gloss will present an evening of new and recent work in the text-sound / sound-poetry tradition. She will perform a new piece for electronics and spoken voice, conduct a participatory language game, and present her new cycle for solo voice, ‚ÄúLullabies for the Psychotic.‚Äù Pauline‚Äôs current body of work is concerned with how the smallest bits of language‚Äî in both their sonic and meaning-making dimensions‚Äî can, through repetition, variation, and syntactical rewiring, create temporary sonic and semantic meaning-making structures. Her work investigates and foregrounds the physicality of language by rendering it architecturally. She makes of its discreet bits shifty semantic and sonic building-blocks whose stability is always already in question.</em><br />

<p><strong>Opening: Kate Parsons - The Dark Spring</strong><br />
Coaxial<br />
7pm - 11pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Coaxial presents &quot;The Dark Spring,‚Äù an installation of new video, floral assemblage, and a virtual reality prototype by Kate Parsons. This will be the culmination of a week-long residency by the artist at the gallery. Live music by Kid606. Virtual Reality prototype: The Dark Spring (ft. Wake by Ryat) &amp; video installations: After Fischli &amp; Weiss. Parsons‚Äôs current work focuses on themes of mortality as a meditation on the passing of time and the celebration of the natural cycle of death and rebirth. An excess of color, beauty and decay is portrayed in the artist‚Äôs‚Äô distinctive electro-Victorian sensibility. This current body of work takes inspiration from such varied subjects as cinema, mythology, literature, religion and anthropology and is interpreted through a hybrid practice consisting of analog and digital video, virtual reality, and found-objects assemblage.</em><br />

<p><strong>House Guest Presents Nina Sarnelle: Dog Dream</strong><br />
8902 Guthrie<br />
6pm - 10pm (performance at 8)<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Dream interpretation is popular in Korea: losing teeth in a dream is an omen for death or loss, snake dreams predict pregnancy, pig dreams bring wealth. The term dog dream (Í∞úÍøà) however, does not refer to a dream with a dog in it‚Äîin this case the dog is the dreamer. Dog dreams are scattered, useless, with no predictive wisdom or meaning whatsoever. In this solo exhibition, Nina Sarnelle will show a series of sculptures made of rope, plastic, animal parts and other materials, alongside a new music composition and video work. Dog Dream is an ongoing investigation of world events, and especially the hyper-masculine posturing of neo-fascist leaders, through the lens of canine psychology: a model based on dominance and submission, fear and aggression.</em><br />

<p><strong>Alternative Realities: Utopian Thought in Times of Political Rupture</strong><br />
The Wende Museum at The Armory, Culver City, California<br />
10:30am - 9pm (continues Tuesday)<br />
FREE<br />
<em>A two-day conference organized by The Max Kade Institute for Austrian-German-Swiss Studies (USC) and The Wende Museum. Co-sponsored by the German Historical Institute and the Centre for Contemporary History, Potsdam (ZZF). Additional support provided by the Feuchtwanger Memorial Library, USC Dornsife Dean‚Äôs Office, and USC Dornsife Departments of Art History, History, and Slavic Languages and Literature. Modern history has been marked by periodic ruptures, radical changes brought on by wars, revolutionary upheaval, or sudden political shifts that shattered existing social and political structures and belief systems. No country has experienced this more profoundly than Germany, which has witnessed five regimes across the past 100 years and experienced both the heights of national euphoria and the depths of physical and moral defeat and destruction in the twentieth century. During times of fundamental change, cultural ideas and expressions pave the way for the imagination of a new order. This conference focuses on the key role of utopian visions, both artistic and intellectual, that changed the world from the twentieth century to the present day.</em><br />
