<p><strong>‚ÄúP√¥r o Corpo a Pensar‚Äù (Making The Body Think)</strong><br />
The Institute For Art and Olfaction<br />
7pm - 9pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>The idea of the project ‚ÄúP√¥r o Corpo a Pensar‚Äù is to establish an exhibition that intersects the realms of art, philosophy and smell. The works created by these perfumers can even be impossible to use in one of those, but they are able to evoke it. They are not perfumes, they are olfactory artworks in the sense proposed by Chandler Burr. They are smells of the body, smells of love, smells of eroticism, smells of the instinct. My intention is not only to pay tribute to the author and to her magnificent work, but also to expand its scope, working upon it, reconnecting the thread that was suddenly cut by her death. Following the line of the organic and sensorial pattern, performer Ondina Pires was invited to create a sound installation, based on vocal and percussive records. The audio translation of the olfactory sensations, under different rhythms and intensities, followed an improvised, experimental and primitive structure. For the exhibition in Los Anegeles, the six existing perfumers are joined by Oliver Valverde and Fulvio Misitano ‚Äì developing new scents for the LA version of the show.</em><br />
