	 <p><strong>Geographies of Displacement</strong> <br />
	 Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery <br />
	 7pm - 9pm <br />
	 FREE <br />
	 <em>Geographies of Displacement will bring together six anti-gentrification groups across East and South Los Angeles: the Crenshaw Subway Coalition, Defend Boyle Heights, North East Los Angeles Alliance, LA Tenants Union, School of Echoes, and Uplifting Inglewood. In this discussion, groups will share their organizing work, contextualize the specific ways in which gentrification is taking place in their neighborhoods, and address how the role of the culture industry opens communities to speculative real estate practices. They will also deliberate how practices of solidarity can develop into a city-wide movement against unjust displacement.</em> <br />
