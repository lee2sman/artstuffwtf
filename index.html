		<p><strong>Indecent Exposure</strong><br />

		<em>Indecent Exposure is a retrospective of Margie Schnibbeâ€™s sexually explicit videos and includes over twenty years of work. Paying homage to Cinemaland, the buildingâ€™s previous tenants, the main gallery is utilized as a casual movie theater, with a ninety-nine minute video program projected as a continuous loop. The seating arrangements are comfortable and migratory; viewers are encouraged to sit close together or far apart, to mingle, to come and go as they please. The upstairs galleries are spaces for invited artists to create intimate performances that encourage participation. The lobby operates as a bar and gift shop. The exhibition is organized by John E. Kush, and will be open nightly.</em><br />
