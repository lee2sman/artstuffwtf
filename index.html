<p><strong>It was quite a fiction</strong><br />
Human Resources<br />
7pm - 10pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>It was quite a fiction brings together artists and practitioners to participate in a two-day proposition that involves conversations and material practices. t was quite a fiction brings together artists and practitioners to participate in a two-day proposition that involves conversations and material practices. We find ourselves constantly thinking about the disconnect between our daily experience and the political and institutional structures we are immersed in. How are these two realms of the personal and the political intra-acting? How does history lay the ground of our everyday experience and possibilities, and in what ways does it impregnate the materiality of our work? Can what we do aesthetically, materially, socially, emotionally, intervene with larger agendas that seem unreachable, oftentimes abstract, and weighing over us? These questions, among others, will thread the program. We are interested in thinking about these open-ended questions with the public at Human Resources.</em><br />

And/Or Gallery<br />
7pm - 9:30pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>For Show #30, Lucas will create an immersive, mediated environment of electronic and computational works that express her intense fascination with flamingos and her deep concerns about climate change. Also on view will be video works from Lucas' Sole Soaker and Sick Waves series, both of which capture the unease and turmoil created by rising sea levels. By using moving images and video game play to induce nausea and disorientation, Lucas' works impel the viewer to feel the physical illness of the Earth and the widespread upheavals climate change has already created.</em><br />

<p><strong>Overburden</strong><br />
Navel<br />
4pm - 7pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>NAVEL presents ‚ÄúOverburden,‚Äù an exhibition of new work by Symrin Chawla and David Ertel. Sculptures of reclaimed subsoil, automotive pigments slated for use in 2018, and California Sea Slug extract weave together the material consequences of natural resource extraction. All works are produced using unwanted overburden sourced from Los Angeles. Tomorrow‚Äôs Liquid Gold uses overburden from a construction site in Central Los Angeles. In a reinterpretation of traditional mud dying techniques, mud is spread over fabric and cracks as it dries in the sun. Phycoerythrin and chlorella powder are poured into the crevices to pigment the fabric below. Phycoerythrin is a red-fluorescent chemical found both in the ink of the California Sea Slug as well as the red algae it eats. Both species have seen a population explosion on the California coastline due to the dumping of phosphate-rich waste. Chlorella is a green algae that is used to digest toxic heavy metals in mine tailings. The resulting fabric is peeled from the mud.</em><br />
