		<p><strong>BURDEN</strong><br />
		Nuart Cinema<br />
		1pm, 3:10pm, 5:20pm, 7:30pm, 9:45pm (also: Saturday and Sunday)<br />
		$9<br />
		<em>Chris Burden guaranteed his place in art history in the 1970s with a series of often dangerous and at times stomach-churning performances. After having himself shot, confined to a locker for five days, electrocuted, and crucified on the back of a VW bug, Burden reinvented himself as a creator of truly mesmerizing installations and sculptures, from a suspended gigantic flywheel that seemingly spins on its own to an assemblage of antique streetlights rewired for solar energy and illuminated outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In the documentary Burden, filmmakers Timothy Marrinan and Richard Dewey look at the artist‚Äôs works and private life with an innovative mix of still-potent videos of his ‚Äò70s performances, personal videos and audio recordings of friends, fellow students, colleagues and critics, and latter-day footage at Burden‚Äôs Topanga Canyon studio, all peppered with the artist‚Äôs thoughts and musings through the years.</em><br />

		<em>Mariah Garnett mixes documentary, narrative and experimental filmmaking practices to make work that accesses existing people and communities beyond her immediate experience.

She holds an MFA from Calarts in Film/Video and a BA from Brown University in American Civilization.

		<p><strong>Pell√©as &amp; M√©lisande with Tim Reid</strong></br> Machine Project<br />

		<em>Machine Project Mystery Theater brings you Pell√©as &amp; M√©lisande, a Vaudeville Symbolist Melodrama by artist/director Tim Reid. Loosely based on the original play by Maurice Maeterlinck, this is a serious play which includes timekeeping, constant weeping, symbols, and an intermission. It is about love and silence. It is also funny sometimes. ‚ÄúMaeterlinck is the Belgian Shakespeare.‚Äù ‚Äî Octave Mirbeau Written by Tim Reid and Meg Whiteford. Dramaturgy by Meg Whiteford. With Sallie Merkel, Tyler Watson, and Prudence Rees-Lee as ‚ÄúThe Orchestra‚Äù.</em><br />

		<p><strong>Breathe in the World, (or, problems with you, me, we, they, hear and see)</strong><br />
		The Hammer Museum<br />
		4 - 5pm (Saturday and Sunday)<br />
		FREE<br />
		<em>This new performance is concerned with the movement of breath in and out of the body through the vector of a new instrument as the primary catalyst. This instrument splits the breath‚Äôs production of sound through analog loops as well as a series of temperature sensors that create independent sound based on data. Three musicians improvise with the single instrument, illustrating the symbiotic connection of the body with its surroundings, analog and digital, communication and chaos. The performance is also an examination of the internal‚Äôs constant negotiation of external life through language, musicality, mis/connections, labor, and material, all wrought with some humor through fear.</em><br />
