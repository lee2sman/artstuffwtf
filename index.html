	 <p><strong>Sign Making Workshop: Taeyoon Choi</strong></br> Los Angeles Contemporary Archive (LACA)<br />
	 11am - 1pm<br />
	 FREE<br />
	 <em>Thereâ€™s something profoundly fulfilling about making your own signs and protesting in the streets. Handwritten signs are personal and compelling. Signs can become an interface between crowd and city, a device to intervene in the public space and a tool for counter-narrative to the mainstream media. Sign making is an artistic form of social engagement. Sign Making Workshop is a chance to think about your message, time to bring voice to your thoughts and give body to your message. It is also a chance to learn from people with different views and priorities. In this workshop, we will reflect on protest signs weâ€™ve seen recently and talk about different ways of creating a simple and effective sign. We will ask the following questions. How do you make signs that start a dialogue, instead of shouting a message in one direction? How do you encapsulate complex messages and emotions into a unique sign? How can we bring artistic practice closer to an activist praxis? Through hands-on, step by step activities, we will progress from writing initial concept to sketching designs. We will create personal protest signs and have a group discussion in the end.</em><br />
