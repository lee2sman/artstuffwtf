<p><strong>Terry Riley's In C performed by David Harrow</strong><br />
Human Resources<br />
8pm - 11pm<br />
$5 suggested<br />
<em>1964: The year that Terry Riley first performed In C, the piece that laid the foundations for the entire minimalist movement, is also the year of my birth. Turning full cycle to the present, a time when contemporary synthesis has brought the principle of variation through repetition to our fingertips, reaching for the sublime through sonic immersion is needed more now than ever. The compositional quality of In C shines through the use of the new media, in fact the way the 53 phrases of the piece work with modern electronic is captivating. By programming them into contemporary sequencing methods new avenues for improvisation are revealed, manipulating the very substance of the sounds themselves.</em><br />
