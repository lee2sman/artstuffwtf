<p><strong>Andrei Tarkovsky: Stalker</strong><br />
The Cinefamily<br />
4pm (continues through July 5th)<br />
$12<br />
<em>One of the greatest films of all time â€“ and perhaps the single greatest science fiction film â€“ Andrei Tarkovskyâ€™s Stalker has long been both a rarity and a touchstone. Smartly flipping a common trope of post-nuclear anxieties, the film follows three men â€“ known simply as Stalker (Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy), Writer (Anatoliy Solonitsyn), and Professor (Nikolai Grinko) â€“ into a government-controlled lockdown zone in search of a room capable of granting its visitorsâ€™ innermost desires. With stunning visuals and almost impossible philosophical scope, Tarkovsky enshrouds religious allegory and political anxieties in quiet realism, constructing a dialogic meditation on art, faith, religion, and love.</em><br />
