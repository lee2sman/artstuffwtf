<p><strong>A World Redrawn: Eisenstein and Brecht in Hollywood</strong><br />
The Velaslavasay Panorama<br />
7:30pm / Presentation 8 / Films 8:30pm<br />
$13/15<br />
<em>In 1930, Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein spent six months in Los Angeles under contract with Paramount. A decade later German playwright and theater director Bertolt Brecht, a refugee from Nazi Germany, lived there from 1941 to 1947. Both set out to make films in Hollywood on their own terms. Working in the world's most famous factory of dreams, they believed that artists must call into question the way we understand our world. In A World Redrawn - a project that encompassed an exhibition, a book and three films - Zoe Beloff explores their unrealized film scenarios &quot;Glass House&quot; and &quot;A Model Family in a Model Home‚Äù and reimagines them for today. TWO MARXISTS IN HOLLYWOOD - 26 minutes HD video, sound (2015) Interviews with Eisenstein and Brecht in contemporary Los Angeles. (Filmed in part at the Velaslavasay Panorama) GLASS HOUSE - 22 minutes HD video, sound (2014) A film based on Eisenstein‚Äôs scenario for a science fiction movie about a world of total visibility that also involves a ruthless robot. A MODEL FAMILY IN A MODEL HOME - 22 minutes HD video sound (2015) This film is inspired by Brecht‚Äôs notes for a movie based on an article in Life Magazine, a farm family win a week's stay in a model home and everything goes wrong.</em><br />
