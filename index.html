<p><strong>Radical Women Celebration</strong><br />

Hammer Museum<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Please join us to celebrate the opening of Radical Women. Be among the first to see the exhibition during Saturday nightâ€™s party, with galleries open late, live music by Jungle Fire, DJ sets by Chulita Vinyl Club, cash bar, and food for purchase all night. Audiences are invited to participate in the restaging of important works by the artists Martha AraÃºjo, MÃ³nica Mayer, and Regina Silveira. Part of Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, this exhibition will reappraise the contribution of Latin American women artists and those of Latino and Chicano heritage in the United States to contemporary art. In a way that no other exhibition has done previously, Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960â€“1985 will give visibility to the artistic practices of women artists working in Latin America and US-born women artists of Latino heritage between 1960 and 1985â€”a key period in Latin American history and in the development of contemporary art. Fifteen countries will be represented in the exhibition by more than one hundred artists, with 260 works in photography, video, and other experimental mediums.</em><br />
