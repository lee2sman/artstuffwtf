<h1>üëπ <a href="http://artstuff.wtf">ARTSTUFF.WTF</a></h1>


<p><strong><a href="http://artstuff.wtf">Artstuff.wtf</a></strong> is a weekly email with a few recommendations for art, music and cultural events in LA. There is now a minimal (alpha version) website for easy access and archive of past announcements.</p>

<p><em>Editor's Note: I particularly enjoyed the Henry Taylor exhibit that closes Saturday. One of the more interesting (and provocative) exhibits I've seen in a commercial gallery in LA in a bit.</em></p>

<h1>FRI 11/04</h1>

<p><strong>Henry Taylor (exhibition closes Saturday)</strong><br/>
Blum and Poe<br/>
Friday and Saturday (<em>editor's note: there is a 'performance' i believe throughout the day Saturday only that added a lot to my enjoyment of the exhibit Saturday</em>)<br/>
10am-6pm<br/>
FREE<br/>
<em>Taylor‚Äôs work continues to delve and expand upon the language of portraiture and painting, while also pointing to the social and political issues affecting African Americans today. From racial inequality, homelessness, and poverty, to the importance of family and community, Taylor says, ‚ÄúMy paintings are what I see around me‚Ä¶they are my landscape paintings.‚Äù Taylor marks the disparity between social classes from one gallery to the next by installing in each space a distinct terrain. An empty, dirt lot beside a lush, grassy lawn inevitably points to the different groups of people who inhabit these spaces. While one space portrays a certain sense of abandon and despair, the other is more about experiencing pleasure and comfort within private property. The subjects in the paintings vary ‚Äì from scenes of Taylor‚Äôs life to imagery inspired by current affairs, candidly depicting the world around him.</em></p>
