		<p><strong>Friday Flights: Molly Surno, Sun Araw, Institute for New Feeling</strong><br />
		Getty Museum<br />
		6pm - 9pm<br />
		FREE (parking costs $10 per car after 3pm)<br />
		<em>Friday Flights is a series of interdisciplinary happenings that invites artists and musicians to transform the Getty experience. The Institute for New Feeling will present a site-specific project altering the visitor experience of the Getty Museum. Something between a public and private film screening, an ominous narrative around an impending major weather event will develop throughout the night, with information, images, and sounds circulating among individual technology devices. Sun Araw is the experimental psychedelic musical project of the Los Angeles-based artist Cameron Stallones, who will perform a unique set in the Getty Museum courtyard. Artist Molly Surno presents We of Me, a performance featuring musician Brian Chase of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, wherein 20 men perform a choreographed soundscape using hand-crafted musical hair brushes. The performers, arranged in a circle in the center of the Getty‚Äôs Tram Arrival Plaza, will prepare their hair, generating tones from the various textures amplified through the electric brush-instruments. Surno and Chase mix the sound in real time as it is generated. The distortions result in a meditative, repetitive, layered composition.</em><br />

		<p><strong>Figure Of Space</strong><br />
		Highways Performance Space<br />
		8:30pm<br />
		$15 / $20<br />
		<em>The fifteenth installment in an ongoing series of new movement-based performance works by emerging and established choreographers, directors and ensembles. Zena Bibler‚Äôs ‚ÄúFigure of Space‚Äù is the latest episode in a series of improvised dances inspired by the format, structure, and contents of folktales. ‚ÄúFigure of Space‚Äù tries to find its place between pantomime and abstraction, between clarity and complexity, between being on and being in. It‚Äôs a holographic narration. A yarn that keeps unraveling. A story bravely told before the end was known. New Shoes 15 features works by Zena Bibler (in collaboration with Darrian O‚ÄôReilly), Heidi Brewer, Rebecca Green, Amanda Hunt &amp; IV Castellanos, and Julie Turner.</em><br />
