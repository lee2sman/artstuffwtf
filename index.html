Revisiting classic titles and introducing new works by key figures and emerging artists, Ism, Ism, Ism takes viewers on a journey through a wealth of materials culled from forgotten corners of Latin American film archives. This marathon opening weekend includes a panel with curators and scholars and six film programs: Latin American surrealist shorts, films made in Southern California by Latinas and Latin American women, a solo presentation by veteran Chicano filmmaker Willie Varela, ‚Äúcamera-less‚Äù films by artists from several countries, documents of diverse countercultural movements, and revelatory shorts regarding revolutionary icon Che Guevara.</em><br />

<p><strong>HEMA: Closing Performance</strong><br />
Coaxial<br />
8pm - 11pm<br />
$?<br />
<em>HEMA is a sound and visual environmental installation, exploring the relationship between forces of nature and human psychology. Artist In Residence Shannon Kennedy performs sound compositions with handmade string instruments in a constructed world where instruments and environment blur together. Kennedy uses natural substances such as fire treated wood, water, metal and air to represent elements of the body and mind. The audience is invited to enter and walk through an immersive, metaphysical and sensory web of sound and structure that is metaphoric of aspects of the body and mind.</em><br />

<p><strong>Jim Haynes ‚Ä¢ Blood & Conquest ‚Ä¢ Mortal Bodies ‚Ä¢ Smokey Emery</strong><br />
Coaxial <br />
8pm - 1am<br/>
$7<br />
Jim Haynes (b. 1972) is a California based artist who has developed a vocabulary of decay that he has applied to photography, sculpture, installation, and sound. Blood and Conquest is collaborative project of Micaela Tobin (White Boy Scream) and Shannon Kennedy (Nephila, Pedestrian Deposit) utilizing their strengths in voice, strings and electronics. Mortal Bodies is the duo of Marc Gonya (Granite Mask) and Marfisia Bel (Harmaline), together operating in a sinister post-industrial haze. Analog synths twist and drone alongside staccato thuds and thumps, echoing into the distance under the gauze of Marfisia's monotone vocals. Since the age of 17, Houston-born Daniel Hip√≥lito has been capturing, fragmenting, and reconfiguring his life experiences as Smokey Emery. Hip√≥lito has become a well-established fixture amongst many experimental and electro-acoustic music circles by releasing a myriad of dense ambient works comprised of dismantled field recordings, reinvented through tape manipulation.</em><br />
