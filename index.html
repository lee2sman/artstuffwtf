<p><strong>Friday Flights: Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle, Psychic Ills, Scott Benzel</strong><br />
The Getty<br />
6pm - 9pm<br />
FREE (parking costs $10 after 3pm)<br />
<em>Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle presents Exploring the Nowannago: Kentifrican Modes of Resistance with Tyler Matthew Oyer. In this provocative performance, Hinkle creates tension with a double-noose tug-of-war, exploring a narrative from a geography called &quot;Kentifrica,&quot; an unknown continent and culture that serves as a meditation upon what can and cannot be mapped when dealing with the ramifications of identity. As part of Hinkle's ongoing artistic navigation of the &quot;historical present,&quot; this performance is offered as a metaphor for how residue of the past remains chained to today, impacting the treatment of bodies deemed &quot;other.&quot; Performed for the first time with live music accompaniment by The Kevin Robinson Ensemble (KREation), Hinkle's performance abstractly confronts a multi-faceted set of contemporary issues from the Black Lives Matters Movement, human trafficking, LGBTQ+ awareness, immigration reform, prison reform, white supremacy, genocide, xenophobia, and more.</em><br />

<p><strong>The Femmes Video Art Festival</strong><br />
The Situation Room<br />
8pm - 10pm<br />
$?<br />
<em>The Femmes‚Äô Video Art Festival is curated from an open call for female-identified video artists to submit works made in the last 3 years. The objective of the festival is to explore and celebrate the issues, themes, and artistic styles that are being addressed by female-identified artists today. The themes of the curatorial selections emerge from the submissions. Now in its third year, we are delighted that the Festival features work by artists from all over the globe, artists who are early in their careers, and artists who are established. The Festival was started by Micol Hebron for The Situation Room in 2015.</em><br />
