		<p><strong>Tashi Wada</strong><br />
		Human Resources<br />
		8pm - 11pm<br />
		$10 suggested<br />
		<em>Music by Tashi Wada performed by Charles Curtis, Dafne Vicente-Sandoval, Tashi Wada and Julia Holter. This program collects three long-form works by composer Tashi Wada that explore diverging aspects of tuning and tonality. Valence (2016), written for cellist Charles Curtis, isolates and reharmonizes the natural overtones of a single string, destabilizing and fusing tone and timbre through a delicate alchemy. Witness (2017), written for bassoonist Dafne Vicente-Sandoval, draws out the relationship between an array of scales and tetrachords (four-note segments of scales) found traditionally in Greek, Persian, and Arabic musics, in combination with hybrid and invented scales, through repetition, variation, and improvisation. Mutable Signs, Wada‚Äôs performance for keyboard, voice, and sirens with guest musician Julia Holter, focuses on the outer edges of historical, non-equal temperaments, eliciting a more distant, uneven sense of tonality.</em><br />

		<p><strong>The World Through Her Eyes: Short Films By Lynne Sachs</strong><br />

		8PM<br />
		$5<br />
		<em>Lynne Sachs makes films, installations, performances and web projects that explore the intricate relationship between personal observations and broader historical experiences by weaving together poetry, collage, painting, politics and layered sound design. Strongly committed to a dialogue between cinematic theory and practice, she searches for a rigorous play between image and sound, pushing the visual and aural textures in her work with each and every new project. Join us for a very special screening of luminous shorts spanning two decades, including a sneak peek at Sachs‚Äô latest, Carolee, Barbara &amp; Gunvor, celebrating the creativity and tenacity of three of experimental film‚Äôs greatest visionaries. FILMMAKER IN ATTENDANCE!</em><br />
