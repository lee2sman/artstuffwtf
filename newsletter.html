				<p><strong>Film Premiere: Frances Stark's The Magic Flute</strong><br />
				LACMA<br />
				7pm - 10pm<br />
				FREE (reservations full. Standby line 6:30pm)<br />
				<em>Premiering at LACMA, Frances Stark‚Äôs newest work, The Magic Flute (2017), is a 110-minute film adaptation of the popular 1791 opera by composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and librettist Emanuel Schikaneder about a prince and a bird catcher who cross paths and endure various tricks and trials in search of love. The vocalists‚Äîthe defining characteristic of the genre‚Äîhave been substituted with soloists who play the vocal melodies, demanding close viewing, reading, and listening. The lyrics have also been updated through Stark‚Äôs creation of an amalgam libretto derived from the study of numerous translations that were then adapted to both fit the instrumental melodies and speak to a contemporary audience. Stark says of the film: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to make The Magic Flute unfold for people very directly and joyously; it isn‚Äôt about clever redressing or anything, it‚Äôs really about the bare bones of the opera having the capacity to engage you, the accessibility of the opera was based on its high-low conceit.‚Äù</em><br />

				<p><strong>Ordinary Scenes and Recurring Dreams: Recent Japanese 8mm Films</strong><br />
				Echo Park Film Center<br />
				8pm<br />
				$?<br />
				<em>The program features a diverse range of contemporary 8mm films by Japanese artists. Although it has been several years since Fuji Film ended the production of Single 8, which was a preferred format among filmmakers in Japan but not for the rest of the world, some filmmakers in Japan are still working with this format ‚Äì they purchased many cartridges when available and stored them for the future. The program begins with Wriggle, an abstract animation with layers of paints on a 2-dimensional surface by Haruka Mitani, followed by Naoaki Miyamoto‚Äôs Tide, which expresses nostalgia through a journey or the flow of a river. Ryo Ishikawa‚Äôs On the Shore is made of dream-like sequences with visual effects that address the materiality of the medium, and A Dream of Smoke displays Madoka Kobata‚Äôs delicate camerawork with the images of a quiet village and others indoor. Kayako Oki‚Äôs Spinning Light conveys further the materiality of the format with a feeling of girlish childhood memories, and Water-soluble Doze by Masaharu Oki depicts the beauty and formality in autumn leaves and others found on the ground. Akio Hikage‚Äôs Tanning the film focuses on a repetitive process that seems eternal, and Ryo Ishikawa‚Äôs found footage film, Drift, also uses an idea of repetition to build the film structure. Vanitas by Yuriko Sato expresses a sense of being confined to a space or one‚Äôs mind, and Sayaka Hayami‚Äôs In These Days illustrates everyday scenes at night in her neighborhood. Fire Balls by Shintaro Kiyonari exhibits views from a train, looking toward the sun, along with shots of a baby crawling, while Junhou Arai‚Äôs For Life: Plum, Bamboo, and Pine shows physical characteristics of the elderly in a very formal way. Curator and several artists will be in attendance.</em><br />
