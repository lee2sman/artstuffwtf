Odwalla 1221 Speaking songs along drumstick trigger samples of whatever they wanna, this couple of sassy aesthetes push poetry and punk gesture, sounding off on body politics with a proximate pop appeal and just enough anti- to keep it in check.

<p><strong>Incendiary Traces opening reception</strong><br />
Los Angeles Contemporary Archive<br />
2pm - 5pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>Incendiary Traces invites viewers to draw the landscape of the Mediterranean within the virtual battlespace of Arma 3. Arma 3 is an open world, military simulation game sited on the fictional island of Atlis, inspired by the real-life Greek island of Lemnos. Derived from US and UK military training simulations, the game imitates real NATO operations that have increased in the region since 2016. In 2012, while the game was in development, two Arma 3 developers vacationing on Lemnos were arrested by Greek authorities, charged with espionage and imprisoned for 129 days for photographing Greek military installations. Drawing in situ, we will look closely at Arma 3‚Äôs version of this landscape in conflict, and consider the politics of visualizing the southern EU border.</em><br />
