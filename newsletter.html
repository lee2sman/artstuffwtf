		<p><strong>Carmina Escobar: FIESTA PERPETUA!</strong><br />
		Echo Park Lake (for REDCAT &amp;&amp; PSTF LA/LA<br />
		1pm - 5pm<br />
		FREE<br />
		<em>Floating rafts on picturesque Echo Park Lake become mobile stages for FIESTA PERPETUA!, a community ritual of manifestation led and conceived by acclaimed experimental Mexican vocalist Carmina Escobar with the 40-member Oaxacan youth brass band Maqueos Music, conducted by Yulissa Maqueos, and celebrated dancer/choreographer Oguri. Throughout the afternoon, performance interventions take place on and around the lake, following a mystical algorithmic schedule until sundown. Originally commissioned by Machine Project, Escobarâ€™s ritualistic performance re-imagines a processional festival as a communal experience that reveals the syncretic, cross-cultural nature of LA.</em><br />

		<p><strong>Matters of Time</strong><br />
		UC Irvine - Contemporary Arts Center Gallery<br />
		2pm - 5pm<br />
		FREE<br />
		<em>What can time heal? What can only time tell? Matters of Time positions the group exhibition form as a locus to challenge conventional concepts of time as a linear progression. This exhibition will feature artwork that materializes the durational in a way that does not render a moment, but translates a semblance of time, an image that evokes a sensorial response activating an awareness of shifting conditions. Moments are suspended rather than depicted, moving us to consider wider contexts of before, after, and consequences. The artworks, which span multiple generations of artists, approach modes of forgetting, entropy, and history from a variety of different vantage points. To examine these interludes and markers of memory the exhibition takes a tripartite approach to situating strategies in temporality: [1] the event revisited [2] the image re-ordered [3] the enduring archive.</em><br />

		<p><strong>Machine Project Print Sale and Wrap Party!</strong><br />
		Machine Project<br />
		2pm - 9pm<br />
		FREE<br />
		<em>Everything has a natural lifespanâ€”crickets, planets, sitcoms, and even art spaces. And so it is with both pride and sweet melancholy that we announce the closing of Machine Project. After fifteen years of experimentation, delirium, and joy, we have finally completed our longest piece: the project of Machine Project. To celebrate the times weâ€™ve shared jumping out of windows, napping joyfully, and frying the unfryable, please join us for one last event at Machine! Our print sale will be from 2-6pm, including our entire catalog of limited edition artist prints, followed by a closing party that will be filled with beer and special surprise performances. Mostly, though, itâ€™s one last chance to get together and marvel at how in the world we got away with doing this stuff for so long.</em><br />
