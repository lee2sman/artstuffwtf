<p>Frau Fiber vs the Machines<br />
Human Resources<br />
12pm - 6pm (through Sunday)<br />
FREE<br />
<em>The works in this exhibition document Frau Fiber‚Äôs on-going battle with contemporary apparel manufacturing. In video, photography and artifacts, the exhibition makes space to witness Frau Fiber‚Äôs attempt to spin yarn, knit a tube sock and knit a sweater as fast as a machine. This series of textile productions are inspired by the folk lore of the ultimate working-class hero: John Henry. Henry, who was immortalized in verse and myth in the 1800‚Äôs, fought and lost a valiant battle against the drill machine that took his life and ultimately replaced the jobs of tireless railroad workers. The exhibition is curated by Frau Fiber‚Äôs archivist and biographer, Carole Frances Lung. Frau Fiber is a textile super-hero who uses pedagogical, material and playful approaches to teach communities about the human cost of mass production and consumption. Many of her spirited durational performances and other projects take place at Frau Fiber‚Äôs store-front headquarters in downtown Long Beach, CA, called the Institute for Labor Generosity Workers and Uniforms(ILGWU). Her legacy project is the Sewing Rebellion, a national campaign to ‚ÄúSTOP SHOPPING AND START SEWING!‚Äù. The Rebellion is a grass roots movement that empowers people through skill-sharing, facilitates community building, and advocates for social change.</em><br />
