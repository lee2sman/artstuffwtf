				<p><strong>Stand In The Stream: opening reception</strong><br />
				Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects<br />
				5pm - 8pm<br />
				FREE<br />
				<em>Shot over the course of six years, &quot;Stand in the Stream&quot; was made using multiple video devices‚Äîfrom cell phones to point-and-shoots, spy and POV cams, large format HD and webcams, and real-time screen recordings of live streams, but contains no found footage. As the cameras incessantly watch strangers in public spaces (IRL and online), intimates in the home, and the natural and man-made worlds, the inextricability of a personal life from a politicized being is made clear and inevitable. Varying stakes in participation, distance, and accountability shift in and out of focus as we move from the tangible world to comment feeds, to independent live-streams and back to IRL. While the visual landscape of the computer screen and its vortex of windows is a recurring location, and all interactions are mediated by a lens, Stand in the Stream returns again and again to the body (human, animal, plant, the artist‚Äôs), drawing attention to the pleasure and discord of modulating back and forth between screen life and ‚Äúreal‚Äù life, and the interstitial spaces where these overlap, both actually and psychologically.</em><br />

				PAM<br />
				8:30pm (also held Sunday evening)<br />
				$5 - 10 suggested donation<br />
				<em>Drawing on the traditions of experimental and political theater, ‚ÄúD-centering Whiteness‚Äù is an improvised, scored conversation between artists Thinh Nguyen and Skip Snow. For their residency at PAM, Nguyen and Snow chose to explore ‚Äúwhite centrality‚Äù as a negotiation of the sometimes painful differences that arise within memory, power and visibility through agreeing to stay in an intimately collaborative process.</em><br />

				<p><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong><br />
				Echo Park Film Center<br />
				8pm<br />
				FREE<br />
				<em>Join us on Easter Sunday for a special holiday screening of Jesus Christ Superstar, Norman Jewison‚Äôs beautiful and bonkers 1973 adaptation of the classic rock opera. Shot entirely on location in Israel, it tells the story of JC‚Äôs last days through the lens of his troubled apostle, Judas Iscariot, and features some of the best and catchiest music ever to hit Broadway. Bring some snacks to share and revel in this magical blend of the sacred, the secular, and some of the finest leotards and biggest hair the 1970s has to offer!</em><br />
