		<em>In celebration of the PST: LA/LA exhibition &quot;A Universal History of Infamy,&quot; LACMA presents a special Art &amp; Music concert with Chicano singer Chris Montez and DJ &amp; documentarian Melissa &quot;Lil Smiley&quot; Due√±as. Due√±as will spin songs from the 1970s compilation East Side Story, followed by a short preview of her documentary where she explores the origins and impact of this iconic record collection. A panel discussion follows with Due√±as, Montez, and visual artist Vincent Ramos, focusing on the Los Angeles Chicano music scene of the 1970s and '80s. The second set will feature Montez and his band. Inspired by Richie Valens, Montez grew up singing Mexican rancheras and went on to record such Top 10 hits as &quot;Let's Dance&quot; and &quot;Call Me.&quot;</em><br />

		<p><strong>Chris Corsano ‚Ä¢ Lay/Haug ‚Ä¢ Alex Zhang Hungtai</strong><br />
		(the) Handbag Factory<br />
		9pm - 11:59pm<br />
		$10<br />
		<em>Corsano is a singular and dynamic figure in improvised music, continually gigging internationally with a epic list of comrades, moving fluidly from fiery collaborations that continue to unfurl the Free Jazz flag. This is his first full solo performance in Los Angeles since April 2010 at Echo Curio. Totally in-the-zone, Lay/Haug is the ongoing duo project of violinist Pauline Lay and drummer Kern Haug. Since joining forces a couple of years back, they've performed in town regularly, their vibe taking flight with Lay's drenchly textured string play and deftly dialed electronics. Since Last Lizard, Alex Zhang Hungtai has continued to explore freer forms and pursue the out-there ‚Äì all around the world, literally, actually. In the past year, he's focused on saxophone and ‚Äì increasingly ‚Äì drums, playing both in a trio with the Portuguese players David Maranha and Gabriel Ferrandini during a sojourn in Lisbon and at gigs across Europe. An itinerant soul, he continues his quest here as an Angeleno and will perform a solo improvised set at this show.</em><br />
