<p><strong>MAREN HASSINGER: THE SPIRIT OF THINGS</strong><br />
Art + Practice<br />
2pm - 5pm<br />
FREE <em>For over four decades, Maren Hassinger has explored relationships between the industrial and natural worlds in a practice that is both meditative and critical. From the 1970s on, her sculpture has incorporated common materials associated with manufacturing, mass media, and commerce. In abstract compositions such as those that will be on view at Art + Practice, she transforms wire rope, newspapers, plastic bags, and more into evocations of the beauty found in conditions often dismissed as blighted or marginal.</em><br />
