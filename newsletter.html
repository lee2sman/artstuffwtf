Machine Project<br />
8:30pm (Thurs - Sun)<br />
$20 - 40<br />
<em>In a troubled world not unlike our own, two lizard-men tumble from the sky to an abandoned jetty by the sea. Inhabited only by a sad sack cyclops, a satanic bird, and a sexy snail, the jetty becomes a raunchy boysâ€™ room, an Edenic dope yard of pleasure and sick until one dayâ€¦Daddyâ€™s home. Soon hazy memories of war, incest, and a parricide fracture the minds of gods and animals and the humans cloaked within them. Smelly, crusty, and full of slime, Sorry, Atlantis, Edenâ€™s Achinâ€™ Organ Seeks Revenge is a comedy about childhood wounds, sexual repression, and the lure of power. Come hide your face from human-sized sea monkeys, trained flies, gushing holes, and sundry mindless lewdities. Wear your rain rubbers! Disclaimer: This play is definitely, totally, and absolutely for adults only</em><br />

Created in context with Lawrence Halprin: Alternative Scores â€“ Drawing from Life, this new work explores how drawing, performance, notation, and evaluation give tangible form to the immaterial aspects of our environment, and help us to better communicate the patterns of lived experience.</em><br />
