		<p><strong>Akio Suzuki and Aki Onda</strong><br />
		Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook (organized by SASSAS)<br />
		4pm - 8pm<br />
		FREE<br />
		<em>SASSAS presents the premiere Los Angeles performance of Japanese sound pioneer Akio Suzuki at the Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook on Sunday, October 22. Joining Akio is New York based interdisciplinary artist Aki Onda. Suzuki is known as a pioneer of sound art, but the breadth of his activities and the form of his works far exceeds the normal boundaries of this genre. Onda is a composer, performer, visual artist, and curator. Onda was born in Japan and currently resides in New York. He is particularly known for his ‚ÄúCassette Memories‚Äù ‚Äî works compiled from a ‚Äúsound diary‚Äù of field-recordings collected by using the cassette Walkman over a span of last quarter-century. He creates compositions, performances, and visual artworks from those sound memories.</em><br />

		<p><strong>Sarah Davachi: Organ and Electronics</strong><br />
		The Museum of Jurassic Technology<br />
		7:30pm / 9:30pm<br />
		$12 / $15<br />
		<em>Like a lot of minimalist art, Sarah Davachi‚Äôs music appears simple on the surface....Her music consists mainly of long held tones. The real action is not found in the notes themselves but in their microtonal variations and the wealth of overtones, harmonics, and ghostly pulses produced by the friction between them. Her work belongs to a tradition of deep, shimmering drone music that... is also profoundly expressive. Her filters sweep back and forth in slow, deliberate, and often unpredictable movements that suggest the careful thought process that drives the hand behind them. The subtlest change can set in motion complicated chain reactions‚Äîebbing and flowing, wheels turning within wheels</em><br />
