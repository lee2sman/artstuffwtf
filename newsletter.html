		Downtown LA<br />
		4pm - 7pm (doors: 3pm)<br />
		FREE with RSVP<br />
		<em>The renowned audiovisual artist presents the worldâ€™s largest synth orchestra. As part of Red Bull Music Academy Festival Los Angeles, renowned artist Ryoji Ikeda will present a brand-new composition, in collaboration with 100 automobile owners, that constitutes the worldâ€™s largest synth orchestra. The piece, entitled A [for 100 cars] will continue Ikedaâ€™s long-running series investigating the frequencies of note A. Before the world settled on the general tuning standard of A=440Hz, there were historically many different standards. A [for 100 cars], performed by emitting sine waves at all these diverse (yet specific) frequencies, will create an immersive soundscape. RBMAâ€™s Tatsuya Takahashi will work with Ikeda to create a device, especially for this performance, that will help guide the composition from start to finish.</em><br />
