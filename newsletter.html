<p><strong>THE FOURTH WORLD</strong><br />
Institute For Art and Olfaction<br />
7pm - 9pm<br />
FREE<br />
<em>These artists question and challenge the idea of the Subject and of the very notion of an objective world by exploring the role of the physical and fluid body, ritual, mythology, language, and the natural and cultural world. They approach inter subjectivity as a domain of inquiry that spans the entire scope of human experience. They flow through worlds, above boundaries, under surfaces, around obstacles and inhabit the spaces in-between. Their work reverberates with energies and frequencies that can be defined as exceptionally rich and layered, transcending fixed notions of identity, language, and place. The exhibition points to the utter futility within binary oppositions, presenting instead the option of asymmetry as one between action and reflection providing a strong feeling for the uncanny and the ultimate weirdness of things. A weirdness that resides in the very presence of things and how they begin to rub against each other in visceral, tactile, sensual, and sensorial ways providing gaps and slips of indeterminate nature. Artists: Mercedes Dorame, Sonja Gerdes, Lindsay August-Salazar, Galia Linn, Karen Lofgren, Alison Oâ€™Daniel, Arden Surdam, Amanda Yates Garcia</em><br />

Pod Blotz is a polymath artist researching the multi-dimensional interferences between haunted pulsations, tape textures, sonic resonance, electrical synthesis, video experiments and human/alien identities anomalies. Gabie Strong is a California artist and musician exploring spatial constructions of degeneration, drone and decay as a means to improvise new arrangements of self-reflexive meaning. Strong uses sound performance, radio broadcasting, environmental installation, photography and video as a mediums for experimentation. Peter Kolovos is a free-improviser from Los Angeles; he plays the electric guitar. Christopher Reid Martin came to birth the solo project known as of Shelter Death, as it has evolved into a project in which performance and sound interplay to make for a personal reactionary experience in a perpetually decaying world.</em><br />
