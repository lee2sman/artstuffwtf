		<h1>ðŸ‘¹ <a href="http://artstuff.wtf">ARTSTUFF.WTF</a></h1>
		<p>Hello, It's my last weekend in Los Angeles. I'm moving to New York where I'll be an assistant professor at Purchase. This is the last Artstuff newsletter. Next week the site will <em>pivot</em> to hosting a list of <a href="spaces.html">spaces</a> for
			DIY WTF Artstuff in LA, as well as the archive of past entries. Thanks for reading. Warmly, Lee</p>

		<p><strong>Additional Content</strong><br /> Electric Lodge<br /> 8pm - 10:30pm<br /> FREE
			<br />
			<em>VIABLE OPTION presents ADDITIONAL CONTENT is an exploration in juxtaposition. Three experimental films will trade off with three experimental music sets for a disorienting thrill-ride through the psyches of six boundary-pushing artists. The event will eschew the oft-used effect of layering film and music simultaneously, instead rapidly alternating between self-contained film and music sets for an 80-minute smorgasbord. In order to fully absorb the magic, audiences will be prompted to rotate their chairs 90 degrees between acts, literally swiveling between film and music for a one-of-a-kind sensory experience.</em><br

		<p><strong>WAYWARD EMULSIONS: FILMS BY TINA TAKEMOTO</strong><br /> Echo Park Film Center<br /> 8pm
			<br /> $5
			<br />
			<em>Fleeting cinematic impressions of wayward women and star-crossed swordsmen are captured in the oblique wanderings of emulsion. Takemotoâ€™s new works explore queer Asian American history and identity through found imagery and an array of handmade techniques including painting, bleaching, and lifting emulsion from stray reels of 35mm films. Takemoto is currently an artist-in-residence for +Lab hosted by Visual Communications and the Little Tokyo Service Center. FILMMAKER IN ATTENDANCE.</em><br

		<p><strong>ALIAS closing reception</strong><br /> Human Resources<br /> 3pm - 6pm<br /> FREE
			<br />
			<em>Alias is an exhibition of new video work by Los Angeles-based artist Sarah Rara. Alias focuses on a characteristic distortion of sampled imagesâ€”Aliasingâ€”where one grid fails to cleanly capture another, and separate entities become indistinguishable. One form ingesting another, a parasite larger than its host: Alias is a story about solar energy, ruined by observation.</em><br
